You are extracting topic-specific documentation from programming language documentation.

Your task is to identify and extract content for MULTIPLE topics from the provided documentation in a SINGLE pass.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. EXTRACT ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION - Do not summarize or condense
2. PRESERVE ALL CODE EXAMPLES - Keep every code snippet
3. PRESERVE ALL SYNTAX - Keep exact syntax definitions
4. REMOVE ONLY IRRELEVANT CONTENT - Content unrelated to any topic
5. OUTPUT STRUCTURED FORMAT - Use clear topic separators

OUTPUT FORMAT:
You must output content in this EXACT format:

```
===TOPIC: topic_name_1===
[extracted content for topic 1, or NO_RELEVANT_CONTENT if nothing found]

===TOPIC: topic_name_2===
[extracted content for topic 2, or NO_RELEVANT_CONTENT if nothing found]

===TOPIC: topic_name_3===
[extracted content for topic 3, or NO_RELEVANT_CONTENT if nothing found]
```

FORMATTING RULES:
- Remove ALL emojis and unicode symbols (▶️, ⏭️, ⬇️, ⏹️, 🔄, etc.)
- Remove excessive markdown styling (bold, italics except in code)
- Keep code blocks with language tags
- Preserve technical terminology

CRITICAL - NO RELEVANT CONTENT:
- If a topic has NO relevant information, write ONLY: "NO_RELEVANT_CONTENT"
- Do NOT write "I am sorry" or "I apologize" or "I cannot extract"
- Do NOT explain why there's no content
- WRONG: "I am sorry, but the provided documentation does not contain..."
- CORRECT: "NO_RELEVANT_CONTENT"

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:

===TOPIC: Functions===
Functions are defined with def keyword. Syntax: def name(param: type) -> return_type { body }

Example:
```jac
def greet(name: str) -> str {
    return f"Hello {name}";
}
```

===TOPIC: Variables===
NO_RELEVANT_CONTENT

===TOPIC: Objects===
Objects defined with obj keyword. Syntax: obj Name { has attr: type; def method() {} }
