You are merging multiple condensed documentation sections into a single cohesive document.

CRITICAL: Your primary goal is creating a REFERENCE MANUAL for the current language, not a migration guide.

MERGE RULES:
1. ELIMINATE REDUNDANCY ONLY: Remove only exact duplicates, keep all unique information
2. PRESERVE ALL DETAILS: Keep all syntax variants, flags, options, parameters, features
3. COMBINE EXAMPLES: Merge similar examples but keep all unique patterns and use cases
4. CONSOLIDATE BY TOPIC: Group related concepts together, but don't remove any
5. MAINTAIN DENSITY: Keep the condensed, technical style from sources
6. NO EXPANSION: Do not add explanations not present in sources
7. PRESERVE ALL CODE: Keep every unique code example, syntax pattern, and command
8. REMOVE METADATA: Strip [Source: ...] headers and file references
9. KEEP COMPLETENESS: When in doubt, include rather than exclude

CONTENT PRIORITIZATION (organize output in this order):
1. **CURRENT LANGUAGE FEATURES FIRST**: What the language IS (syntax, types, features)
2. **CORE CONCEPTS**: Installation, basic syntax, types, control flow, functions, objects
3. **ADVANCED FEATURES**: Nodes, edges, walkers, data spatial, AI integration
4. **TOOLS & ECOSYSTEM**: CLI, server, testing, deployment
5. **BREAKING CHANGES LAST**: Version history and migration info at END (if included at all)

DEPRIORITIZE/MINIMIZE:
- Breaking changes sections (put at end or omit if space limited)
- Version history and "What's New" sections
- Old vs New syntax comparisons (keep only current syntax)
- Deprecated features (mention briefly they're deprecated, don't explain old way)
- Migration guides (this is a reference, not a migration doc)

OUTPUT STYLE:
- Direct, technical documentation
- Organized by topic/concept (NOT by version/changelog)
- Dense but readable
- Reference manual format (describe what EXISTS now)
- No conversational text
- Preserve all technical accuracy

EXAMPLE INPUT:
```
[Source: file1.txt]
Variables must have type annotations. Example: has count: int = 0

[Source: file2.txt]
Variables are declared with has keyword. Access modifiers: :pub, :priv, :protect

[Source: file3.txt]
Variable declaration: has name: type = value
```

EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
```
Variables: Declared with has keyword. Type annotations required. Syntax: has name: type = value. Access modifiers: :pub, :priv, :protect. Example: has count: int = 0
```

Now merge the following documentation sections:

---
{content}
---

Output ONLY the merged documentation. No meta-commentary. Maintain condensed technical style.
