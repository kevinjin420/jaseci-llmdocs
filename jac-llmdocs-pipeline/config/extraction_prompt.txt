You are extracting topic-specific documentation from programming language documentation.

Your task is to identify and extract ALL content related to the specified topic(s) from the provided documentation, preserving complete technical accuracy and detail.

CRITICAL RULES:
1. EXTRACT ALL RELEVANT INFORMATION - Do not summarize or condense
2. PRESERVE ALL CODE EXAMPLES - Keep every code snippet related to the topic
3. PRESERVE ALL SYNTAX - Keep exact syntax definitions and patterns
4. PRESERVE ALL DETAILS - Parameters, options, flags, edge cases, warnings
5. REMOVE ONLY IRRELEVANT CONTENT - Content unrelated to the specified topic(s)
6. MAINTAIN CONTEXT - Keep enough surrounding context to make examples understandable
7. NO REFORMATTING - Keep original structure, just extract relevant sections

EXTRACTION PROCESS:
1. Read through the entire documentation
2. Identify all sections, paragraphs, code examples related to the topic
3. Extract these sections completely, preserving:
   - All explanatory text
   - All code examples
   - All syntax definitions
   - All parameters and options
   - All warnings and notes
   - All edge cases
4. Remove only content that is completely unrelated to the topic
5. If a section partially relates, include the entire section

TOPIC RELEVANCE:
- Extract content that directly discusses the topic
- Extract content that shows examples of the topic
- Extract content that explains how to use the topic
- Extract content that shows the topic in context with other features
- Extract content that shows common patterns with the topic
- Extract content that warns about gotchas or edge cases with the topic

WHAT TO REMOVE:
- Content about completely different topics
- Breaking changes UNLESS they directly affect the current topic syntax
- Version history UNLESS it clarifies current behavior
- Migration guides UNLESS they explain current syntax

OUTPUT FORMAT:
- Plain text with minimal markdown
- Remove ALL emojis and unicode symbols (▶️, ⏭️, ⬇️, ⏹️, 🔄, etc.)
- Remove excessive markdown styling (bold, italics unless in code)
- Include section headers for organization
- Keep code blocks with language tags
- Preserve all technical terminology

CRITICAL - NO RELEVANT CONTENT:
- If the documentation contains NO information related to a topic, output ONLY: "NO_RELEVANT_CONTENT"
- Do NOT write "I am sorry" or "I apologize" or "I cannot extract"
- Do NOT explain why there's no content
- WRONG: "I am sorry, but the provided documentation does not contain..."
- CORRECT: "NO_RELEVANT_CONTENT"
- If you find yourself typing an apology, STOP and just write: NO_RELEVANT_CONTENT

EXAMPLE:

TOPIC: Functions
INPUT:
```
# Jac Language Overview

Jac is a programming language. It has many features.

## Functions

Functions are defined with def keyword. Example:
```jac
def greet(name: str) -> str {
    return f"Hello {name}";
}
```

Functions can be async:
```jac
async def fetch_data() -> dict {
    return await api_call();
}
```

## Nodes

Nodes are graph elements...
```
