Accessibility
Why Accessibility?  Web accessibility (also referred to as a11y) is the design and creation of websites that can be used by everyone. Accessibility support is necessary to allow assistive technology to interpret web pages. React fully supports building accessible websites, often by using standard HTML techniques. Standards and Guidelines  WCAG  The Web Content Accessibility Guidelines provides guidelines for creating accessible web sites. The following WCAG checklists provide an overview:  WCAG checklist from Wuhcag WCAG checklist from WebAIM Checklist from The A11Y Project  WAI-ARIA  The Web Accessibility Initiative - Accessible Rich Internet Applications document contains techniques for building fully accessible JavaScript widgets. Note that all aria-* HTML attributes are fully supported in JSX. Whereas most DOM properties and attributes in React are camelCased, these attributes should be hyphen-cased (also known as kebab-case, lisp-case, etc) as they are in plain HTML: <input
  type="text"
  aria-label={labelText}  aria-required="true"  onChange={onchangeHandler}
  value={inputValue}
  name="name"
/> Semantic HTML  Semantic HTML is the foundation of accessibility in a web application. Using the various HTML elements to reinforce the meaning of information in our websites will often give us accessibility for free.  MDN HTML elements reference  Sometimes we break HTML semantics when we add <div> elements to our JSX to make our React code work, especially when working with lists (<ol>, <ul> and <dl>) and the HTML <table>. In these cases we should rather use React Fragments to group together multiple elements. For example, import React, { Fragment } from 'react';
function ListItem({ item }) {
  return (
    <Fragment>
      <dt>{item.term}</dt>
      <dd>{item.description}</dd>
    </Fragment>
  );
}
function Glossary(props) {
  return (
    <dl>
      {props.items.map(item => (
        <ListItem item={item} key={item.id} />
      ))}
    </dl>
  );
} You can map a collection of items to an array of fragments as you would any other type of element as well: function Glossary(props) {
  return (
    <dl>
      {props.items.map(item => (
        // Fragments should also have a `key` prop when mapping collections
        <Fragment key={item.id}>
          <dt>{item.term}</dt>
          <dd>{item.description}</dd>
        </Fragment>
      ))}
    </dl>
  );
} When you don’t need any props on the Fragment tag you can use the short syntax, if your tooling supports it: function ListItem({ item }) {
  return (
    <>
      <dt>{item.term}</dt>
      <dd>{item.description}</dd>
    </>
  );
} For more info, see the Fragments documentation. Accessible Forms  Labeling  Every HTML form control, such as <input> and <textarea>, needs to be labeled accessibly. We need to provide descriptive labels that are also exposed to screen readers. The following resources show us how to do this:  The W3C shows us how to label elements WebAIM shows us how to label elements The Paciello Group explains accessible names  Although these standard HTML practices can be directly used in React, note that the for attribute is written as htmlFor in JSX: <label htmlFor="namedInput">Name:</label>
<input id="namedInput" type="text" name="name"/> Notifying the user of errors  Error situations need to be understood by all users. The following link shows us how to expose error texts to screen readers as well:  The W3C demonstrates user notifications WebAIM looks at form validation  Focus Control  Ensure that your web application can be fully operated with the keyboard only:  WebAIM talks about keyboard accessibility  Keyboard focus and focus outline  Keyboard focus refers to the current element in the DOM that is selected to accept input from the keyboard. We see it everywhere as a focus outline similar to that shown in the following image:    Only ever use CSS that removes this outline, for example by setting outline: 0, if you are replacing it with another focus outline implementation. Mechanisms to skip to desired content  Provide a mechanism to allow users to skip past navigation sections in your application as this assists and speeds up keyboard navigation. Skiplinks or Skip Navigation Links are hidden navigation links that only become visible when keyboard users interact with the page. They are very easy to implement with internal page anchors and some styling:  WebAIM - Skip Navigation Links  Also use landmark elements and roles, such as <main> and <aside>, to demarcate page regions as assistive technology allow the user to quickly navigate to these sections. Read more about the use of these elements to enhance accessibility here:  Accessible Landmarks  Programmatically managing focus  Our React applications continuously modify the HTML DOM during runtime, sometimes leading to keyboard focus being lost or set to an unexpected element. In order to repair this, we need to programmatically nudge the keyboard focus in the right direction. For example, by resetting keyboard focus to a button that opened a modal window after that modal window is closed. MDN Web Docs takes a look at this and describes how we can build keyboard-navigable JavaScript widgets. To set focus in React, we can use Refs to DOM elements. Using this, we first create a ref to an element in the JSX of a component class: class CustomTextInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // Create a ref to store the textInput DOM element
    this.textInput = React.createRef();
  }
  render() {
  // Use the `ref` callback to store a reference to the text input DOM
  // element in an instance field (for example, this.textInput).
    return (
      <input
        type="text"
        ref={this.textInput}      />
    );
  }
} Then we can focus it elsewhere in our component when needed: focus() {
  // Explicitly focus the text input using the raw DOM API
  // Note: we're accessing "current" to get the DOM node
  this.textInput.current.focus();
} Sometimes a parent component needs to set focus to an element in a child component. We can do this by exposing DOM refs to parent components through a special prop on the child component that forwards the parent’s ref to the child’s DOM node. function CustomTextInput(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={props.inputRef} />
    </div>
  );
}
class Parent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.inputElement = React.createRef();
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <CustomTextInput inputRef={this.inputElement} />
    );
  }
}
// Now you can set focus when required.
this.inputElement.current.focus(); When using a HOC to extend components, it is recommended to forward the ref to the wrapped component using the forwardRef function of React. If a third party HOC does not implement ref forwarding, the above pattern can still be used as a fallback. A great focus management example is the react-aria-modal. This is a relatively rare example of a fully accessible modal window. Not only does it set initial focus on the cancel button (preventing the keyboard user from accidentally activating the success action) and trap keyboard focus inside the modal, it also resets focus back to the element that initially triggered the modal.  Note: While this is a very important accessibility feature, it is also a technique that should be used judiciously. Use it to repair the keyboard focus flow when it is disturbed, not to try and anticipate how users want to use applications.  Mouse and pointer events  Ensure that all functionality exposed through a mouse or pointer event can also be accessed using the keyboard alone. Depending only on the pointer device will lead to many cases where keyboard users cannot use your application. To illustrate this, let’s look at a prolific example of broken accessibility caused by click events. This is the outside click pattern, where a user can disable an opened popover by clicking outside the element.  This is typically implemented by attaching a click event to the window object that closes the popover: class OuterClickExample extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { isOpen: false };
    this.toggleContainer = React.createRef();
    this.onClickHandler = this.onClickHandler.bind(this);
    this.onClickOutsideHandler = this.onClickOutsideHandler.bind(this);
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    window.addEventListener('click', this.onClickOutsideHandler);
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    window.removeEventListener('click', this.onClickOutsideHandler);
  }
  onClickHandler() {
    this.setState(currentState => ({
      isOpen: !currentState.isOpen
    }));
  }
  onClickOutsideHandler(event) {
    if (this.state.isOpen && !this.toggleContainer.current.contains(event.target)) {
      this.setState({ isOpen: false });
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div ref={this.toggleContainer}>
        <button onClick={this.onClickHandler}>Select an option</button>
        {this.state.isOpen && (
          <ul>
            <li>Option 1</li>
            <li>Option 2</li>
            <li>Option 3</li>
          </ul>
        )}
      </div>
    );
  }
} This may work fine for users with pointer devices, such as a mouse, but operating this with the keyboard alone leads to broken functionality when tabbing to the next element as the window object never receives a click event. This can lead to obscured functionality which blocks users from using your application.  The same functionality can be achieved by using appropriate event handlers instead, such as onBlur and onFocus: class BlurExample extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { isOpen: false };
    this.timeOutId = null;
    this.onClickHandler = this.onClickHandler.bind(this);
    this.onBlurHandler = this.onBlurHandler.bind(this);
    this.onFocusHandler = this.onFocusHandler.bind(this);
  }
  onClickHandler() {
    this.setState(currentState => ({
      isOpen: !currentState.isOpen
    }));
  }
  // We close the popover on the next tick by using setTimeout.
  // This is necessary because we need to first check if
  // another child of the element has received focus as
  // the blur event fires prior to the new focus event.
  onBlurHandler() {
    this.timeOutId = setTimeout(() => {
      this.setState({
        isOpen: false
      });
    });
  }
  // If a child receives focus, do not close the popover.
  onFocusHandler() {
    clearTimeout(this.timeOutId);
  }
  render() {
    // React assists us by bubbling the blur and
    // focus events to the parent.
    return (
      <div onBlur={this.onBlurHandler}           onFocus={this.onFocusHandler}>
        <button onClick={this.onClickHandler}
                aria-haspopup="true"
                aria-expanded={this.state.isOpen}>
          Select an option
        </button>
        {this.state.isOpen && (
          <ul>
            <li>Option 1</li>
            <li>Option 2</li>
            <li>Option 3</li>
          </ul>
        )}
      </div>
    );
  }
} This code exposes the functionality to both pointer device and keyboard users. Also note the added aria-* props to support screen-reader users. For simplicity’s sake the keyboard events to enable arrow key interaction of the popover options have not been implemented.  This is one example of many cases where depending on only pointer and mouse events will break functionality for keyboard users. Always testing with the keyboard will immediately highlight the problem areas which can then be fixed by using keyboard aware event handlers. More Complex Widgets  A more complex user experience should not mean a less accessible one. Whereas accessibility is most easily achieved by coding as close to HTML as possible, even the most complex widget can be coded accessibly. Here we require knowledge of ARIA Roles as well as ARIA States and Properties. These are toolboxes filled with HTML attributes that are fully supported in JSX and enable us to construct fully accessible, highly functional React components. Each type of widget has a specific design pattern and is expected to function in a certain way by users and user agents alike:  WAI-ARIA Authoring Practices - Design Patterns and Widgets Heydon Pickering - ARIA Examples Inclusive Components  Other Points for Consideration  Setting the language  Indicate the human language of page texts as screen reader software uses this to select the correct voice settings:  WebAIM - Document Language  Setting the document title  Set the document <title> to correctly describe the current page content as this ensures that the user remains aware of the current page context:  WCAG - Understanding the Document Title Requirement  We can set this in React using the React Document Title Component. Color contrast  Ensure that all readable text on your website has sufficient color contrast to remain maximally readable by users with low vision:  WCAG - Understanding the Color Contrast Requirement Everything About Color Contrast And Why You Should Rethink It A11yProject - What is Color Contrast  It can be tedious to manually calculate the proper color combinations for all cases in your website so instead, you can calculate an entire accessible color palette with Colorable. Both the aXe and WAVE tools mentioned below also include color contrast tests and will report on contrast errors. If you want to extend your contrast testing abilities you can use these tools:  WebAIM - Color Contrast Checker The Paciello Group - Color Contrast Analyzer  Development and Testing Tools  There are a number of tools we can use to assist in the creation of accessible web applications. The keyboard  By far the easiest and also one of the most important checks is to test if your entire website can be reached and used with the keyboard alone. Do this by:  Disconnecting your mouse. Using Tab and Shift+Tab to browse. Using Enter to activate elements. Where required, using your keyboard arrow keys to interact with some elements, such as menus and dropdowns.  Development assistance  We can check some accessibility features directly in our JSX code. Often intellisense checks are already provided in JSX aware IDE’s for the ARIA roles, states and properties. We also have access to the following tool: eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y  The eslint-plugin-jsx-a11y plugin for ESLint provides AST linting feedback regarding accessibility issues in your JSX. Many IDE’s allow you to integrate these findings directly into code analysis and source code windows. Create React App has this plugin with a subset of rules activated. If you want to enable even more accessibility rules, you can create an .eslintrc file in the root of your project with this content: {
  "extends": ["react-app", "plugin:jsx-a11y/recommended"],
  "plugins": ["jsx-a11y"]
} Testing accessibility in the browser  A number of tools exist that can run accessibility audits on web pages in your browser. Please use them in combination with other accessibility checks mentioned here as they can only test the technical accessibility of your HTML. aXe, aXe-core and react-axe  Deque Systems offers aXe-core for automated and end-to-end accessibility tests of your applications. This module includes integrations for Selenium. The Accessibility Engine or aXe, is an accessibility inspector browser extension built on aXe-core. You can also use the @axe-core/react module to report these accessibility findings directly to the console while developing and debugging. WebAIM WAVE  The Web Accessibility Evaluation Tool is another accessibility browser extension. Accessibility inspectors and the Accessibility Tree  The Accessibility Tree is a subset of the DOM tree that contains accessible objects for every DOM element that should be exposed to assistive technology, such as screen readers. In some browsers we can easily view the accessibility information for each element in the accessibility tree:  Using the Accessibility Inspector in Firefox Using the Accessibility Inspector in Chrome Using the Accessibility Inspector in OS X Safari  Screen readers  Testing with a screen reader should form part of your accessibility tests. Please note that browser / screen reader combinations matter. It is recommended that you test your application in the browser best suited to your screen reader of choice. Commonly Used Screen Readers  NVDA in Firefox  NonVisual Desktop Access or NVDA is an open source Windows screen reader that is widely used. Refer to the following guides on how to best use NVDA:  WebAIM - Using NVDA to Evaluate Web Accessibility Deque - NVDA Keyboard Shortcuts  VoiceOver in Safari  VoiceOver is an integrated screen reader on Apple devices. Refer to the following guides on how to activate and use VoiceOver:  WebAIM - Using VoiceOver to Evaluate Web Accessibility Deque - VoiceOver for OS X Keyboard Shortcuts Deque - VoiceOver for iOS Shortcuts  JAWS in Internet Explorer  Job Access With Speech or JAWS, is a prolifically used screen reader on Windows.

add-react-to-a-website
-----------------------------------------------------------
Add React to a Website
Use as little or as much React as you need. React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Perhaps you only want to add some “sprinkles of interactivity” to an existing page. React components are a great way to do that. The majority of websites aren’t, and don’t need to be, single-page apps. With a few lines of code and no build tooling, try React in a small part of your website. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets.  Add React in One Minute 
Optional: Try React with JSX (no bundler necessary!)  Add React in One Minute  In this section, we will show how to add a React component to an existing HTML page. You can follow along with your own website, or create an empty HTML file to practice. There will be no complicated tools or install requirements — to complete this section, you only need an internet connection, and a minute of your time. Optional: Download the full example (2KB zipped) Step 1: Add a DOM Container to the HTML  First, open the HTML page you want to edit. Add an empty <div> tag to mark the spot where you want to display something with React. For example: <!-- ... existing HTML ... -->
<div id="like_button_container"></div>
<!-- ... existing HTML ... --> We gave this <div> a unique id HTML attribute. This will allow us to find it from the JavaScript code later and display a React component inside of it.  Tip You can place a “container” <div> like this anywhere inside the <body> tag. You may have as many independent DOM containers on one page as you need. They are usually empty — React will replace any existing content inside DOM containers.  Step 2: Add the Script Tags  Next, add three <script> tags to the HTML page right before the closing </body> tag:   <!-- ... other HTML ... -->
  <!-- Load React. -->
  <!-- Note: when deploying, replace "development.js" with "production.min.js". -->
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
  <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>
  <!-- Load our React component. -->
  <script src="like_button.js"></script>
</body> The first two tags load React. The third one will load your component code. Step 3: Create a React Component  Create a file called like_button.js next to your HTML page. Open this starter code and paste it into the file you created.  Tip This code defines a React component called LikeButton. Don’t worry if you don’t understand it yet — we’ll cover the building blocks of React later in our hands-on tutorial and main concepts guide. For now, let’s just get it showing on the screen!  After the starter code, add two lines to the bottom of like_button.js: // ... the starter code you pasted ...
const domContainer = document.querySelector('#like_button_container');
ReactDOM.render(e(LikeButton), domContainer);
 These two lines of code find the <div> we added to our HTML in the first step, and then display our “Like” button React component inside of it. That’s It!  There is no step four. You have just added the first React component to your website. Check out the next sections for more tips on integrating React. View the full example source code Download the full example (2KB zipped) Tip: Reuse a Component  Commonly, you might want to display React components in multiple places on the HTML page. Here is an example that displays the “Like” button three times and passes some data to it: View the full example source code Download the full example (2KB zipped)  Note This strategy is mostly useful while React-powered parts of the page are isolated from each other. Inside React code, it’s easier to use component composition instead.  Tip: Minify JavaScript for Production  Before deploying your website to production, be mindful that unminified JavaScript can significantly slow down the page for your users. If you already minify the application scripts, your site will be production-ready if you ensure that the deployed HTML loads the versions of React ending in production.min.js: <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.production.min.js" crossorigin></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.production.min.js" crossorigin></script> If you don’t have a minification step for your scripts, here’s one way to set it up. Optional: Try React with JSX  In the examples above, we only relied on features that are natively supported by browsers. This is why we used a JavaScript function call to tell React what to display: const e = React.createElement;
// Display a "Like" <button>
return e(
  'button',
  { onClick: () => this.setState({ liked: true }) },
  'Like'
); However, React also offers an option to use JSX instead: // Display a "Like" <button>
return (
  <button onClick={() => this.setState({ liked: true })}>
    Like
  </button>
); These two code snippets are equivalent. While JSX is completely optional, many people find it helpful for writing UI code — both with React and with other libraries. You can play with JSX using this online converter. Quickly Try JSX  The quickest way to try JSX in your project is to add this <script> tag to your page: <script src="https://unpkg.com/babel-standalone@6/babel.min.js"></script> Now you can use JSX in any <script> tag by adding type="text/babel" attribute to it. Here is an example HTML file with JSX that you can download and play with. This approach is fine for learning and creating simple demos. However, it makes your website slow and isn’t suitable for production. When you’re ready to move forward, remove this new <script> tag and the type="text/babel" attributes you’ve added. Instead, in the next section you will set up a JSX preprocessor to convert all your <script> tags automatically. Add JSX to a Project  Adding JSX to a project doesn’t require complicated tools like a bundler or a development server. Essentially, adding JSX is a lot like adding a CSS preprocessor. The only requirement is to have Node.js installed on your computer. Go to your project folder in the terminal, and paste these two commands:  
Step 1: Run npm init -y (if it fails, here’s a fix) 
Step 2: Run npm install babel-cli@6 babel-preset-react-app@3
   Tip We’re using npm here only to install the JSX preprocessor; you won’t need it for anything else. Both React and the application code can stay as <script> tags with no changes.  Congratulations! You just added a production-ready JSX setup to your project. Run JSX Preprocessor  Create a folder called src and run this terminal command: npx babel --watch src --out-dir . --presets react-app/prod  Note npx is not a typo — it’s a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+. If you see an error message saying “You have mistakenly installed the babel package”, you might have missed the previous step. Perform it in the same folder, and then try again.  Don’t wait for it to finish — this command starts an automated watcher for JSX. If you now create a file called src/like_button.js with this JSX starter code, the watcher will create a preprocessed like_button.js with the plain JavaScript code suitable for the browser. When you edit the source file with JSX, the transform will re-run automatically. As a bonus, this also lets you use modern JavaScript syntax features like classes without worrying about breaking older browsers. The tool we just used is called Babel, and you can learn more about it from its documentation. If you notice that you’re getting comfortable with build tools and want them to do more for you, the next section describes some of the most popular and approachable toolchains. If not — those script tags will do just fine!

cdn-links
-----------------------------------------------------------
CDN Links
Both React and ReactDOM are available over a CDN. <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.development.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.development.js"></script> The versions above are only meant for development, and are not suitable for production. Minified and optimized production versions of React are available at: <script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script crossorigin src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script> To load a specific version of react and react-dom, replace 17 with the version number. Why the crossorigin Attribute?  If you serve React from a CDN, we recommend to keep the crossorigin attribute set: <script crossorigin src="..."></script> We also recommend to verify that the CDN you are using sets the Access-Control-Allow-Origin: * HTTP header:      This enables a better error handling experience in React 16 and later.

code-splitting
-----------------------------------------------------------
Code-Splitting
Bundling  Most React apps will have their files “bundled” using tools like Webpack, Rollup or Browserify. Bundling is the process of following imported files and merging them into a single file: a “bundle”. This bundle can then be included on a webpage to load an entire app at once. Example  App: // app.js
import { add } from './math.js';
console.log(add(16, 26)); // 42 // math.js
export function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
} Bundle: function add(a, b) {
  return a + b;
}
console.log(add(16, 26)); // 42  Note: Your bundles will end up looking a lot different than this.  If you’re using Create React App, Next.js, Gatsby, or a similar tool, you will have a Webpack setup out of the box to bundle your app. If you aren’t, you’ll need to set up bundling yourself. For example, see the Installation and Getting Started guides on the Webpack docs. Code Splitting  Bundling is great, but as your app grows, your bundle will grow too. Especially if you are including large third-party libraries. You need to keep an eye on the code you are including in your bundle so that you don’t accidentally make it so large that your app takes a long time to load. To avoid winding up with a large bundle, it’s good to get ahead of the problem and start “splitting” your bundle. Code-Splitting is a feature supported by bundlers like Webpack, Rollup and Browserify (via factor-bundle) which can create multiple bundles that can be dynamically loaded at runtime. Code-splitting your app can help you “lazy-load” just the things that are currently needed by the user, which can dramatically improve the performance of your app. While you haven’t reduced the overall amount of code in your app, you’ve avoided loading code that the user may never need, and reduced the amount of code needed during the initial load. 
import()  The best way to introduce code-splitting into your app is through the dynamic import() syntax. Before: import { add } from './math';
console.log(add(16, 26)); After: import("./math").then(math => {
  console.log(math.add(16, 26));
}); When Webpack comes across this syntax, it automatically starts code-splitting your app. If you’re using Create React App, this is already configured for you and you can start using it immediately. It’s also supported out of the box in Next.js. If you’re setting up Webpack yourself, you’ll probably want to read Webpack’s guide on code splitting. Your Webpack config should look vaguely like this. When using Babel, you’ll need to make sure that Babel can parse the dynamic import syntax but is not transforming it. For that you will need @babel/plugin-syntax-dynamic-import. 
React.lazy   Note: React.lazy and Suspense are not yet available for server-side rendering. If you want to do code-splitting in a server rendered app, we recommend Loadable Components. It has a nice guide for bundle splitting with server-side rendering.  The React.lazy function lets you render a dynamic import as a regular component. Before: import OtherComponent from './OtherComponent'; After: const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent')); This will automatically load the bundle containing the OtherComponent when this component is first rendered. React.lazy takes a function that must call a dynamic import(). This must return a Promise which resolves to a module with a default export containing a React component. The lazy component should then be rendered inside a Suspense component, which allows us to show some fallback content (such as a loading indicator) while we’re waiting for the lazy component to load. import React, { Suspense } from 'react';
const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <OtherComponent />
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
} The fallback prop accepts any React elements that you want to render while waiting for the component to load. You can place the Suspense component anywhere above the lazy component. You can even wrap multiple lazy components with a single Suspense component. import React, { Suspense } from 'react';
const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));
const AnotherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./AnotherComponent'));
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <section>
          <OtherComponent />
          <AnotherComponent />
        </section>
      </Suspense>
    </div>
  );
} Error boundaries  If the other module fails to load (for example, due to network failure), it will trigger an error. You can handle these errors to show a nice user experience and manage recovery with Error Boundaries. Once you’ve created your Error Boundary, you can use it anywhere above your lazy components to display an error state when there’s a network error. import React, { Suspense } from 'react';
import MyErrorBoundary from './MyErrorBoundary';
const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));
const AnotherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./AnotherComponent'));
const MyComponent = () => (
  <div>
    <MyErrorBoundary>
      <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
        <section>
          <OtherComponent />
          <AnotherComponent />
        </section>
      </Suspense>
    </MyErrorBoundary>
  </div>
); Route-based code splitting  Deciding where in your app to introduce code splitting can be a bit tricky. You want to make sure you choose places that will split bundles evenly, but won’t disrupt the user experience. A good place to start is with routes. Most people on the web are used to page transitions taking some amount of time to load. You also tend to be re-rendering the entire page at once so your users are unlikely to be interacting with other elements on the page at the same time. Here’s an example of how to setup route-based code splitting into your app using libraries like React Router with React.lazy. import React, { Suspense, lazy } from 'react';
import { BrowserRouter as Router, Routes, Route } from 'react-router-dom';
const Home = lazy(() => import('./routes/Home'));
const About = lazy(() => import('./routes/About'));
const App = () => (
  <Router>
    <Suspense fallback={<div>Loading...</div>}>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Home />} />
        <Route path="/about" element={<About />} />
      </Routes>
    </Suspense>
  </Router>
); Named Exports  React.lazy currently only supports default exports. If the module you want to import uses named exports, you can create an intermediate module that reexports it as the default. This ensures that tree shaking keeps working and that you don’t pull in unused components. // ManyComponents.js
export const MyComponent = /* ... */;
export const MyUnusedComponent = /* ... */; // MyComponent.js
export { MyComponent as default } from "./ManyComponents.js"; // MyApp.js
import React, { lazy } from 'react';
const MyComponent = lazy(() => import("./MyComponent.js"));

components-and-props
-----------------------------------------------------------
Components and Props
Components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. This page provides an introduction to the idea of components. You can find a detailed component API reference here. Conceptually, components are like JavaScript functions. They accept arbitrary inputs (called “props”) and return React elements describing what should appear on the screen. Function and Class Components  The simplest way to define a component is to write a JavaScript function: function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
} This function is a valid React component because it accepts a single “props” (which stands for properties) object argument with data and returns a React element. We call such components “function components” because they are literally JavaScript functions. You can also use an ES6 class to define a component: class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
} The above two components are equivalent from React’s point of view. Function and Class components both have some additional features that we will discuss in the next sections. Rendering a Component  Previously, we only encountered React elements that represent DOM tags: const element = <div />; However, elements can also represent user-defined components: const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />; When React sees an element representing a user-defined component, it passes JSX attributes and children to this component as a single object. We call this object “props”. For example, this code renders “Hello, Sara” on the page: function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
const element = <Welcome name="Sara" />;
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
); Try it on CodePen Let’s recap what happens in this example:  We call ReactDOM.render() with the <Welcome name="Sara" /> element. React calls the Welcome component with {name: 'Sara'} as the props. Our Welcome component returns a <h1>Hello, Sara</h1> element as the result. React DOM efficiently updates the DOM to match <h1>Hello, Sara</h1>.   Note: Always start component names with a capital letter. React treats components starting with lowercase letters as DOM tags. For example, <div /> represents an HTML div tag, but <Welcome /> represents a component and requires Welcome to be in scope. To learn more about the reasoning behind this convention, please read JSX In Depth.  Composing Components  Components can refer to other components in their output. This lets us use the same component abstraction for any level of detail. A button, a form, a dialog, a screen: in React apps, all those are commonly expressed as components. For example, we can create an App component that renders Welcome many times: function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
}
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Welcome name="Sara" />
      <Welcome name="Cahal" />
      <Welcome name="Edite" />
    </div>
  );
}
ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
); Try it on CodePen Typically, new React apps have a single App component at the very top. However, if you integrate React into an existing app, you might start bottom-up with a small component like Button and gradually work your way to the top of the view hierarchy. Extracting Components  Don’t be afraid to split components into smaller components. For example, consider this Comment component: function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <div className="UserInfo">
        <img className="Avatar"
          src={props.author.avatarUrl}
          alt={props.author.name}
        />
        <div className="UserInfo-name">
          {props.author.name}
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
} Try it on CodePen It accepts author (an object), text (a string), and date (a date) as props, and describes a comment on a social media website. This component can be tricky to change because of all the nesting, and it is also hard to reuse individual parts of it. Let’s extract a few components from it. First, we will extract Avatar: function Avatar(props) {
  return (
    <img className="Avatar"      src={props.user.avatarUrl}      alt={props.user.name}    />
  );
} The Avatar doesn’t need to know that it is being rendered inside a Comment. This is why we have given its prop a more generic name: user rather than author. We recommend naming props from the component’s own point of view rather than the context in which it is being used. We can now simplify Comment a tiny bit: function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <div className="UserInfo">
        <Avatar user={props.author} />
        <div className="UserInfo-name">
          {props.author.name}
        </div>
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
} Next, we will extract a UserInfo component that renders an Avatar next to the user’s name: function UserInfo(props) {
  return (
    <div className="UserInfo">
      <Avatar user={props.user} />
      <div className="UserInfo-name">
        {props.user.name}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
} This lets us simplify Comment even further: function Comment(props) {
  return (
    <div className="Comment">
      <UserInfo user={props.author} />
      <div className="Comment-text">
        {props.text}
      </div>
      <div className="Comment-date">
        {formatDate(props.date)}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
} Try it on CodePen Extracting components might seem like grunt work at first, but having a palette of reusable components pays off in larger apps. A good rule of thumb is that if a part of your UI is used several times (Button, Panel, Avatar), or is complex enough on its own (App, FeedStory, Comment), it is a good candidate to be extracted to a separate component. Props are Read-Only  Whether you declare a component as a function or a class, it must never modify its own props. Consider this sum function: function sum(a, b) {
  return a + b;
} Such functions are called “pure” because they do not attempt to change their inputs, and always return the same result for the same inputs. In contrast, this function is impure because it changes its own input: function withdraw(account, amount) {
  account.total -= amount;
} React is pretty flexible but it has a single strict rule: All React components must act like pure functions with respect to their props. Of course, application UIs are dynamic and change over time. In the next section, we will introduce a new concept of “state”. State allows React components to change their output over time in response to user actions, network responses, and anything else, without violating this rule.

composition-vs-inheritance
-----------------------------------------------------------
Composition vs Inheritance
React has a powerful composition model, and we recommend using composition instead of inheritance to reuse code between components. In this section, we will consider a few problems where developers new to React often reach for inheritance, and show how we can solve them with composition. Containment  Some components don’t know their children ahead of time. This is especially common for components like Sidebar or Dialog that represent generic “boxes”. We recommend that such components use the special children prop to pass children elements directly into their output: function FancyBorder(props) {
  return (
    <div className={'FancyBorder FancyBorder-' + props.color}>
      {props.children}
    </div>
  );
} This lets other components pass arbitrary children to them by nesting the JSX: function WelcomeDialog() {
  return (
    <FancyBorder color="blue">
      <h1 className="Dialog-title">
        Welcome
      </h1>
      <p className="Dialog-message">
        Thank you for visiting our spacecraft!
      </p>
    </FancyBorder>
  );
} Try it on CodePen Anything inside the <FancyBorder> JSX tag gets passed into the FancyBorder component as a children prop. Since FancyBorder renders {props.children} inside a <div>, the passed elements appear in the final output. While this is less common, sometimes you might need multiple “holes” in a component. In such cases you may come up with your own convention instead of using children: function SplitPane(props) {
  return (
    <div className="SplitPane">
      <div className="SplitPane-left">
        {props.left}
      </div>
      <div className="SplitPane-right">
        {props.right}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}
function App() {
  return (
    <SplitPane
      left={
        <Contacts />      }
      right={
        <Chat />      } />
  );
} Try it on CodePen React elements like <Contacts /> and <Chat /> are just objects, so you can pass them as props like any other data. This approach may remind you of “slots” in other libraries but there are no limitations on what you can pass as props in React. Specialization  Sometimes we think about components as being “special cases” of other components. For example, we might say that a WelcomeDialog is a special case of Dialog. In React, this is also achieved by composition, where a more “specific” component renders a more “generic” one and configures it with props: function Dialog(props) {
  return (
    <FancyBorder color="blue">
      <h1 className="Dialog-title">
        {props.title}
      </h1>
      <p className="Dialog-message">
        {props.message}
      </p>
    </FancyBorder>
  );
}
function WelcomeDialog() {
  return (
    <Dialog      title="Welcome"      message="Thank you for visiting our spacecraft!" />
  );
} Try it on CodePen Composition works equally well for components defined as classes: function Dialog(props) {
  return (
    <FancyBorder color="blue">
      <h1 className="Dialog-title">
        {props.title}
      </h1>
      <p className="Dialog-message">
        {props.message}
      </p>
      {props.children}
    </FancyBorder>
  );
}
class SignUpDialog extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSignUp = this.handleSignUp.bind(this);
    this.state = {login: ''};
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <Dialog title="Mars Exploration Program"
              message="How should we refer to you?">
        <input value={this.state.login}               onChange={this.handleChange} />
        <button onClick={this.handleSignUp}>
          Sign Me Up!
        </button>
      </Dialog>
    );
  }
  handleChange(e) {
    this.setState({login: e.target.value});
  }
  handleSignUp() {
    alert(`Welcome aboard, ${this.state.login}!`);
  }
} Try it on CodePen So What About Inheritance?  At Facebook, we use React in thousands of components, and we haven’t found any use cases where we would recommend creating component inheritance hierarchies. Props and composition give you all the flexibility you need to customize a component’s look and behavior in an explicit and safe way. Remember that components may accept arbitrary props, including primitive values, React elements, or functions. If you want to reuse non-UI functionality between components, we suggest extracting it into a separate JavaScript module. The components may import it and use that function, object, or a class, without extending it.

conditional-rendering
-----------------------------------------------------------
Conditional Rendering
In React, you can create distinct components that encapsulate behavior you need. Then, you can render only some of them, depending on the state of your application. Conditional rendering in React works the same way conditions work in JavaScript. Use JavaScript operators like if or the conditional operator to create elements representing the current state, and let React update the UI to match them. Consider these two components: function UserGreeting(props) {
  return <h1>Welcome back!</h1>;
}
function GuestGreeting(props) {
  return <h1>Please sign up.</h1>;
} We’ll create a Greeting component that displays either of these components depending on whether a user is logged in: function Greeting(props) {
  const isLoggedIn = props.isLoggedIn;
  if (isLoggedIn) {
    return <UserGreeting />;
  }
  return <GuestGreeting />;
}
ReactDOM.render(
  // Try changing to isLoggedIn={true}:
  <Greeting isLoggedIn={false} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
); Try it on CodePen This example renders a different greeting depending on the value of isLoggedIn prop. Element Variables  You can use variables to store elements. This can help you conditionally render a part of the component while the rest of the output doesn’t change. Consider these two new components representing Logout and Login buttons: function LoginButton(props) {
  return (
    <button onClick={props.onClick}>
      Login
    </button>
  );
}
function LogoutButton(props) {
  return (
    <button onClick={props.onClick}>
      Logout
    </button>
  );
} In the example below, we will create a stateful component called LoginControl. It will render either <LoginButton /> or <LogoutButton /> depending on its current state. It will also render a <Greeting /> from the previous example: class LoginControl extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleLoginClick = this.handleLoginClick.bind(this);
    this.handleLogoutClick = this.handleLogoutClick.bind(this);
    this.state = {isLoggedIn: false};
  }
  handleLoginClick() {
    this.setState({isLoggedIn: true});
  }
  handleLogoutClick() {
    this.setState({isLoggedIn: false});
  }
  render() {
    const isLoggedIn = this.state.isLoggedIn;
    let button;
    if (isLoggedIn) {
      button = <LogoutButton onClick={this.handleLogoutClick} />;
    } else {
      button = <LoginButton onClick={this.handleLoginClick} />;
    }
    return (
      <div>
        <Greeting isLoggedIn={isLoggedIn} />
        {button}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(
  <LoginControl />,
  document.getElementById('root')
); Try it on CodePen While declaring a variable and using an if statement is a fine way to conditionally render a component, sometimes you might want to use a shorter syntax. There are a few ways to inline conditions in JSX, explained below. Inline If with Logical && Operator  You may embed expressions in JSX by wrapping them in curly braces. This includes the JavaScript logical && operator. It can be handy for conditionally including an element: function Mailbox(props) {
  const unreadMessages = props.unreadMessages;
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      {unreadMessages.length > 0 &&
        <h2>
          You have {unreadMessages.length} unread messages.
        </h2>
      }
    </div>
  );
}
const messages = ['React', 'Re: React', 'Re:Re: React'];
ReactDOM.render(
  <Mailbox unreadMessages={messages} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
); Try it on CodePen It works because in JavaScript, true && expression always evaluates to expression, and false && expression always evaluates to false. Therefore, if the condition is true, the element right after && will appear in the output. If it is false, React will ignore and skip it. Note that returning a falsy expression will still cause the element after && to be skipped but will return the falsy expression. In the example below, <div>0</div> will be returned by the render method. render() {
  const count = 0;
  return (
    <div>
      { count && <h1>Messages: {count}</h1>}
    </div>
  );
} Inline If-Else with Conditional Operator  Another method for conditionally rendering elements inline is to use the JavaScript conditional operator condition ? true : false. In the example below, we use it to conditionally render a small block of text. render() {
  const isLoggedIn = this.state.isLoggedIn;
  return (
    <div>
      The user is <b>{isLoggedIn ? 'currently' : 'not'}</b> logged in.
    </div>
  );
} It can also be used for larger expressions although it is less obvious what’s going on: render() {
  const isLoggedIn = this.state.isLoggedIn;
  return (
    <div>
      {isLoggedIn
        ? <LogoutButton onClick={this.handleLogoutClick} />
        : <LoginButton onClick={this.handleLoginClick} />
      }
    </div>
  );
} Just like in JavaScript, it is up to you to choose an appropriate style based on what you and your team consider more readable. Also remember that whenever conditions become too complex, it might be a good time to extract a component. Preventing Component from Rendering  In rare cases you might want a component to hide itself even though it was rendered by another component. To do this return null instead of its render output. In the example below, the <WarningBanner /> is rendered depending on the value of the prop called warn. If the value of the prop is false, then the component does not render: function WarningBanner(props) {
  if (!props.warn) {
    return null;
  }
  return (
    <div className="warning">
      Warning!
    </div>
  );
}
class Page extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {showWarning: true};
    this.handleToggleClick = this.handleToggleClick.bind(this);
  }
  handleToggleClick() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      showWarning: !state.showWarning
    }));
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <WarningBanner warn={this.state.showWarning} />
        <button onClick={this.handleToggleClick}>
          {this.state.showWarning ? 'Hide' : 'Show'}
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(
  <Page />,
  document.getElementById('root')
); Try it on CodePen Returning null from a component’s render method does not affect the firing of the component’s lifecycle methods. For instance componentDidUpdate will still be called.

context
-----------------------------------------------------------
Context
Context provides a way to pass data through the component tree without having to pass props down manually at every level. In a typical React application, data is passed top-down (parent to child) via props, but such usage can be cumbersome for certain types of props (e.g. locale preference, UI theme) that are required by many components within an application. Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.  When to Use Context Before You Use Context  API  React.createContext Context.Provider Class.contextType Context.Consumer Context.displayName    Examples  Dynamic Context Updating Context from a Nested Component Consuming Multiple Contexts   Caveats Legacy API  When to Use Context  Context is designed to share data that can be considered “global” for a tree of React components, such as the current authenticated user, theme, or preferred language. For example, in the code below we manually thread through a “theme” prop in order to style the Button component:
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <Toolbar theme="dark" />;
  }
}
function Toolbar(props) {
  // The Toolbar component must take an extra "theme" prop
  // and pass it to the ThemedButton. This can become painful
  // if every single button in the app needs to know the theme
  // because it would have to be passed through all components.
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemedButton theme={props.theme} />
    </div>
  );
}
class ThemedButton extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <Button theme={this.props.theme} />;
  }
} Using context, we can avoid passing props through intermediate elements:
// Context lets us pass a value deep into the component tree
// without explicitly threading it through every component.
// Create a context for the current theme (with "light" as the default).
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // Use a Provider to pass the current theme to the tree below.
    // Any component can read it, no matter how deep it is.
    // In this example, we're passing "dark" as the current value.
    return (
      <ThemeContext.Provider value="dark">
        <Toolbar />
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
  }
}
// A component in the middle doesn't have to
// pass the theme down explicitly anymore.
function Toolbar() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemedButton />
    </div>
  );
}
class ThemedButton extends React.Component {
  // Assign a contextType to read the current theme context.
  // React will find the closest theme Provider above and use its value.
  // In this example, the current theme is "dark".
  static contextType = ThemeContext;
  render() {
    return <Button theme={this.context} />;
  }
} Before You Use Context  Context is primarily used when some data needs to be accessible by many components at different nesting levels. Apply it sparingly because it makes component reuse more difficult. If you only want to avoid passing some props through many levels, component composition is often a simpler solution than context. For example, consider a Page component that passes a user and avatarSize prop several levels down so that deeply nested Link and Avatar components can read it: <Page user={user} avatarSize={avatarSize} />
// ... which renders ...
<PageLayout user={user} avatarSize={avatarSize} />
// ... which renders ...
<NavigationBar user={user} avatarSize={avatarSize} />
// ... which renders ...
<Link href={user.permalink}>
  <Avatar user={user} size={avatarSize} />
</Link> It might feel redundant to pass down the user and avatarSize props through many levels if in the end only the Avatar component really needs it. It’s also annoying that whenever the Avatar component needs more props from the top, you have to add them at all the intermediate levels too. One way to solve this issue without context is to pass down the Avatar component itself so that the intermediate components don’t need to know about the user or avatarSize props: function Page(props) {
  const user = props.user;
  const userLink = (
    <Link href={user.permalink}>
      <Avatar user={user} size={props.avatarSize} />
    </Link>
  );
  return <PageLayout userLink={userLink} />;
}
// Now, we have:
<Page user={user} avatarSize={avatarSize} />
// ... which renders ...
<PageLayout userLink={...} />
// ... which renders ...
<NavigationBar userLink={...} />
// ... which renders ...
{props.userLink} With this change, only the top-most Page component needs to know about the Link and Avatar components’ use of user and avatarSize. This inversion of control can make your code cleaner in many cases by reducing the amount of props you need to pass through your application and giving more control to the root components. Such inversion, however, isn’t the right choice in every case; moving more complexity higher in the tree makes those higher-level components more complicated and forces the lower-level components to be more flexible than you may want. You’re not limited to a single child for a component. You may pass multiple children, or even have multiple separate “slots” for children, as documented here: function Page(props) {
  const user = props.user;
  const content = <Feed user={user} />;
  const topBar = (
    <NavigationBar>
      <Link href={user.permalink}>
        <Avatar user={user} size={props.avatarSize} />
      </Link>
    </NavigationBar>
  );
  return (
    <PageLayout
      topBar={topBar}
      content={content}
    />
  );
} This pattern is sufficient for many cases when you need to decouple a child from its immediate parents. You can take it even further with render props if the child needs to communicate with the parent before rendering. However, sometimes the same data needs to be accessible by many components in the tree, and at different nesting levels. Context lets you “broadcast” such data, and changes to it, to all components below. Common examples where using context might be simpler than the alternatives include managing the current locale, theme, or a data cache. API  
React.createContext  const MyContext = React.createContext(defaultValue); Creates a Context object. When React renders a component that subscribes to this Context object it will read the current context value from the closest matching Provider above it in the tree. The defaultValue argument is only used when a component does not have a matching Provider above it in the tree. This default value can be helpful for testing components in isolation without wrapping them. Note: passing undefined as a Provider value does not cause consuming components to use defaultValue. 
Context.Provider  <MyContext.Provider value={/* some value */}> Every Context object comes with a Provider React component that allows consuming components to subscribe to context changes. The Provider component accepts a value prop to be passed to consuming components that are descendants of this Provider. One Provider can be connected to many consumers. Providers can be nested to override values deeper within the tree. All consumers that are descendants of a Provider will re-render whenever the Provider’s value prop changes. The propagation from Provider to its descendant consumers (including .contextType and useContext) is not subject to the shouldComponentUpdate method, so the consumer is updated even when an ancestor component skips an update. Changes are determined by comparing the new and old values using the same algorithm as Object.is.  Note The way changes are determined can cause some issues when passing objects as value: see Caveats.  
Class.contextType  class MyClass extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    let value = this.context;
    /* perform a side-effect at mount using the value of MyContext */
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    let value = this.context;
    /* ... */
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    let value = this.context;
    /* ... */
  }
  render() {
    let value = this.context;
    /* render something based on the value of MyContext */
  }
}
MyClass.contextType = MyContext; The contextType property on a class can be assigned a Context object created by React.createContext(). Using this property lets you consume the nearest current value of that Context type using this.context. You can reference this in any of the lifecycle methods including the render function.  Note: You can only subscribe to a single context using this API. If you need to read more than one see Consuming Multiple Contexts. If you are using the experimental public class fields syntax, you can use a static class field to initialize your contextType.  class MyClass extends React.Component {
  static contextType = MyContext;
  render() {
    let value = this.context;
    /* render something based on the value */
  }
} 
Context.Consumer  <MyContext.Consumer>
  {value => /* render something based on the context value */}
</MyContext.Consumer> A React component that subscribes to context changes. Using this component lets you subscribe to a context within a function component. Requires a function as a child. The function receives the current context value and returns a React node. The value argument passed to the function will be equal to the value prop of the closest Provider for this context above in the tree. If there is no Provider for this context above, the value argument will be equal to the defaultValue that was passed to createContext().  Note For more information about the ‘function as a child’ pattern, see render props.  
Context.displayName  Context object accepts a displayName string property. React DevTools uses this string to determine what to display for the context. For example, the following component will appear as MyDisplayName in the DevTools: const MyContext = React.createContext(/* some value */);
MyContext.displayName = 'MyDisplayName';
<MyContext.Provider> // "MyDisplayName.Provider" in DevTools
<MyContext.Consumer> // "MyDisplayName.Consumer" in DevTools Examples  Dynamic Context  A more complex example with dynamic values for the theme: theme-context.js 
export const themes = {
  light: {
    foreground: '#000000',
    background: '#eeeeee',
  },
  dark: {
    foreground: '#ffffff',
    background: '#222222',
  },
};
export const ThemeContext = React.createContext(
  themes.dark // default value
);
 themed-button.js 
import {ThemeContext} from './theme-context';
class ThemedButton extends React.Component {
  render() {
    let props = this.props;
    let theme = this.context;
    return (
      <button
        {...props}
        style={{backgroundColor: theme.background}}
      />
    );
  }
}
ThemedButton.contextType = ThemeContext;
export default ThemedButton; app.js 
import {ThemeContext, themes} from './theme-context';
import ThemedButton from './themed-button';
// An intermediate component that uses the ThemedButton
function Toolbar(props) {
  return (
    <ThemedButton onClick={props.changeTheme}>
      Change Theme
    </ThemedButton>
  );
}
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      theme: themes.light,
    };
    this.toggleTheme = () => {
      this.setState(state => ({
        theme:
          state.theme === themes.dark
            ? themes.light
            : themes.dark,
      }));
    };
  }
  render() {
    // The ThemedButton button inside the ThemeProvider
    // uses the theme from state while the one outside uses
    // the default dark theme
    return (
      <Page>
        <ThemeContext.Provider value={this.state.theme}>
          <Toolbar changeTheme={this.toggleTheme} />
        </ThemeContext.Provider>
        <Section>
          <ThemedButton />
        </Section>
      </Page>
    );
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.root); Updating Context from a Nested Component  It is often necessary to update the context from a component that is nested somewhere deeply in the component tree. In this case you can pass a function down through the context to allow consumers to update the context: theme-context.js 
// Make sure the shape of the default value passed to
// createContext matches the shape that the consumers expect!
export const ThemeContext = React.createContext({
  theme: themes.dark,
  toggleTheme: () => {},
}); theme-toggler-button.js 
import {ThemeContext} from './theme-context';
function ThemeTogglerButton() {
  // The Theme Toggler Button receives not only the theme
  // but also a toggleTheme function from the context
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Consumer>
      {({theme, toggleTheme}) => (
        <button
          onClick={toggleTheme}
          style={{backgroundColor: theme.background}}>
          Toggle Theme
        </button>
      )}
    </ThemeContext.Consumer>
  );
}
export default ThemeTogglerButton; app.js 
import {ThemeContext, themes} from './theme-context';
import ThemeTogglerButton from './theme-toggler-button';
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.toggleTheme = () => {
      this.setState(state => ({
        theme:
          state.theme === themes.dark
            ? themes.light
            : themes.dark,
      }));
    };
    // State also contains the updater function so it will
    // be passed down into the context provider
    this.state = {
      theme: themes.light,
      toggleTheme: this.toggleTheme,
    };
  }
  render() {
    // The entire state is passed to the provider
    return (
      <ThemeContext.Provider value={this.state}>
        <Content />
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
  }
}
function Content() {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemeTogglerButton />
    </div>
  );
}
ReactDOM.render(<App />, document.root); Consuming Multiple Contexts  To keep context re-rendering fast, React needs to make each context consumer a separate node in the tree.
// Theme context, default to light theme
const ThemeContext = React.createContext('light');
// Signed-in user context
const UserContext = React.createContext({
  name: 'Guest',
});
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const {signedInUser, theme} = this.props;
    // App component that provides initial context values
    return (
      <ThemeContext.Provider value={theme}>
        <UserContext.Provider value={signedInUser}>
          <Layout />
        </UserContext.Provider>
      </ThemeContext.Provider>
    );
  }
}
function Layout() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Sidebar />
      <Content />
    </div>
  );
}
// A component may consume multiple contexts
function Content() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Consumer>
      {theme => (
        <UserContext.Consumer>
          {user => (
            <ProfilePage user={user} theme={theme} />
          )}
        </UserContext.Consumer>
      )}
    </ThemeContext.Consumer>
  );
} If two or more context values are often used together, you might want to consider creating your own render prop component that provides both. Caveats  Because context uses reference identity to determine when to re-render, there are some gotchas that could trigger unintentional renders in consumers when a provider’s parent re-renders. For example, the code below will re-render all consumers every time the Provider re-renders because a new object is always created for value:
class App extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <MyContext.Provider value={{something: 'something'}}>
        <Toolbar />
      </MyContext.Provider>
    );
  }
} To get around this, lift the value into the parent’s state:
class App extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      value: {something: 'something'},
    };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <MyContext.Provider value={this.state.value}>
        <Toolbar />
      </MyContext.Provider>
    );
  }
} Legacy API   Note React previously shipped with an experimental context API. The old API will be supported in all 16.x releases, but applications using it should migrate to the new version. The legacy API will be removed in a future major React version. Read the legacy context docs here.

create-a-new-react-app
-----------------------------------------------------------
Create a New React App
Use an integrated toolchain for the best user and developer experience. This page describes a few popular React toolchains which help with tasks like:  Scaling to many files and components. Using third-party libraries from npm. Detecting common mistakes early. Live-editing CSS and JS in development. Optimizing the output for production.  The toolchains recommended on this page don’t require configuration to get started. You Might Not Need a Toolchain  If you don’t experience the problems described above or don’t feel comfortable using JavaScript tools yet, consider adding React as a plain <script> tag on an HTML page, optionally with JSX. This is also the easiest way to integrate React into an existing website. You can always add a larger toolchain if you find it helpful! Recommended Toolchains  The React team primarily recommends these solutions:  If you’re learning React or creating a new single-page app, use Create React App. If you’re building a server-rendered website with Node.js, try Next.js. If you’re building a static content-oriented website, try Gatsby. If you’re building a component library or integrating with an existing codebase, try More Flexible Toolchains.  Create React App  Create React App is a comfortable environment for learning React, and is the best way to start building a new single-page application in React. It sets up your development environment so that you can use the latest JavaScript features, provides a nice developer experience, and optimizes your app for production. You’ll need to have Node >= 14.0.0 and npm >= 5.6 on your machine. To create a project, run: npx create-react-app my-app
cd my-app
npm start  Note npx on the first line is not a typo — it’s a package runner tool that comes with npm 5.2+.  Create React App doesn’t handle backend logic or databases; it just creates a frontend build pipeline, so you can use it with any backend you want. Under the hood, it uses Babel and webpack, but you don’t need to know anything about them. When you’re ready to deploy to production, running npm run build will create an optimized build of your app in the build folder. You can learn more about Create React App from its README and the User Guide. Next.js  Next.js is a popular and lightweight framework for static and server‑rendered applications built with React. It includes styling and routing solutions out of the box, and assumes that you’re using Node.js as the server environment. Learn Next.js from its official guide. Gatsby  Gatsby is the best way to create static websites with React. It lets you use React components, but outputs pre-rendered HTML and CSS to guarantee the fastest load time. Learn Gatsby from its official guide and a gallery of starter kits. More Flexible Toolchains  The following toolchains offer more flexibility and choice. We recommend them to more experienced users:  
Neutrino combines the power of webpack with the simplicity of presets, and includes a preset for React apps and React components. 
Nx is a toolkit for full-stack monorepo development, with built-in support for React, Next.js, Express, and more. 
Parcel is a fast, zero configuration web application bundler that works with React. 
Razzle is a server-rendering framework that doesn’t require any configuration, but offers more flexibility than Next.js.  Creating a Toolchain from Scratch  A JavaScript build toolchain typically consists of:  A package manager, such as Yarn or npm. It lets you take advantage of a vast ecosystem of third-party packages, and easily install or update them. A bundler, such as webpack or Parcel. It lets you write modular code and bundle it together into small packages to optimize load time. A compiler such as Babel. It lets you write modern JavaScript code that still works in older browsers.  If you prefer to set up your own JavaScript toolchain from scratch, check out this guide that re-creates some of the Create React App functionality. Don’t forget to ensure your custom toolchain is correctly set up for production.

dom-elements
-----------------------------------------------------------
DOM Elements
React implements a browser-independent DOM system for performance and cross-browser compatibility. We took the opportunity to clean up a few rough edges in browser DOM implementations. In React, all DOM properties and attributes (including event handlers) should be camelCased. For example, the HTML attribute tabindex corresponds to the attribute tabIndex in React. The exception is aria-* and data-* attributes, which should be lowercased. For example, you can keep aria-label as aria-label. Differences In Attributes  There are a number of attributes that work differently between React and HTML: checked  The checked attribute is supported by <input> components of type checkbox or radio. You can use it to set whether the component is checked. This is useful for building controlled components. defaultChecked is the uncontrolled equivalent, which sets whether the component is checked when it is first mounted. className  To specify a CSS class, use the className attribute. This applies to all regular DOM and SVG elements like <div>, <a>, and others. If you use React with Web Components (which is uncommon), use the class attribute instead. dangerouslySetInnerHTML  dangerouslySetInnerHTML is React’s replacement for using innerHTML in the browser DOM. In general, setting HTML from code is risky because it’s easy to inadvertently expose your users to a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack. So, you can set HTML directly from React, but you have to type out dangerouslySetInnerHTML and pass an object with a __html key, to remind yourself that it’s dangerous. For example: function createMarkup() {
  return {__html: 'First &middot; Second'};
}
function MyComponent() {
  return <div dangerouslySetInnerHTML={createMarkup()} />;
} htmlFor  Since for is a reserved word in JavaScript, React elements use htmlFor instead. onChange  The onChange event behaves as you would expect it to: whenever a form field is changed, this event is fired. We intentionally do not use the existing browser behavior because onChange is a misnomer for its behavior and React relies on this event to handle user input in real time. selected  If you want to mark an <option> as selected, reference the value of that option in the value of its <select> instead. Check out “The select Tag” for detailed instructions. style   Note Some examples in the documentation use style for convenience, but using the style attribute as the primary means of styling elements is generally not recommended. In most cases, className should be used to reference classes defined in an external CSS stylesheet. style is most often used in React applications to add dynamically-computed styles at render time. See also FAQ: Styling and CSS.  The style attribute accepts a JavaScript object with camelCased properties rather than a CSS string. This is consistent with the DOM style JavaScript property, is more efficient, and prevents XSS security holes. For example: const divStyle = {
  color: 'blue',
  backgroundImage: 'url(' + imgUrl + ')',
};
function HelloWorldComponent() {
  return <div style={divStyle}>Hello World!</div>;
} Note that styles are not autoprefixed. To support older browsers, you need to supply corresponding style properties: const divStyle = {
  WebkitTransition: 'all', // note the capital 'W' here
  msTransition: 'all' // 'ms' is the only lowercase vendor prefix
};
function ComponentWithTransition() {
  return <div style={divStyle}>This should work cross-browser</div>;
} Style keys are camelCased in order to be consistent with accessing the properties on DOM nodes from JS (e.g. node.style.backgroundImage). Vendor prefixes other than ms should begin with a capital letter. This is why WebkitTransition has an uppercase “W”. React will automatically append a “px” suffix to certain numeric inline style properties. If you want to use units other than “px”, specify the value as a string with the desired unit. For example: // Result style: '10px'
<div style={{ height: 10 }}>
  Hello World!
</div>
// Result style: '10%'
<div style={{ height: '10%' }}>
  Hello World!
</div> Not all style properties are converted to pixel strings though. Certain ones remain unitless (eg zoom, order, flex). A complete list of unitless properties can be seen here. suppressContentEditableWarning  Normally, there is a warning when an element with children is also marked as contentEditable, because it won’t work. This attribute suppresses that warning. Don’t use this unless you are building a library like Draft.js that manages contentEditable manually. suppressHydrationWarning  If you use server-side React rendering, normally there is a warning when the server and the client render different content. However, in some rare cases, it is very hard or impossible to guarantee an exact match. For example, timestamps are expected to differ on the server and on the client. If you set suppressHydrationWarning to true, React will not warn you about mismatches in the attributes and the content of that element. It only works one level deep, and is intended to be used as an escape hatch. Don’t overuse it. You can read more about hydration in the ReactDOM.hydrate() documentation. value  The value attribute is supported by <input>, <select> and <textarea> components. You can use it to set the value of the component. This is useful for building controlled components. defaultValue is the uncontrolled equivalent, which sets the value of the component when it is first mounted. All Supported HTML Attributes  As of React 16, any standard or custom DOM attributes are fully supported. React has always provided a JavaScript-centric API to the DOM. Since React components often take both custom and DOM-related props, React uses the camelCase convention just like the DOM APIs: <div tabIndex={-1} />      // Just like node.tabIndex DOM API
<div className="Button" /> // Just like node.className DOM API
<input readOnly={true} />  // Just like node.readOnly DOM API These props work similarly to the corresponding HTML attributes, with the exception of the special cases documented above. Some of the DOM attributes supported by React include: accept acceptCharset accessKey action allowFullScreen alt async autoComplete
autoFocus autoPlay capture cellPadding cellSpacing challenge charSet checked
cite classID className colSpan cols content contentEditable contextMenu controls
controlsList coords crossOrigin data dateTime default defer dir disabled

error-boundaries
-----------------------------------------------------------
Error Boundaries
In the past, JavaScript errors inside components used to corrupt React’s internal state and cause it to emit cryptic errors on next renders. These errors were always caused by an earlier error in the application code, but React did not provide a way to handle them gracefully in components, and could not recover from them. Introducing Error Boundaries  A JavaScript error in a part of the UI shouldn’t break the whole app. To solve this problem for React users, React 16 introduces a new concept of an “error boundary”. Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. Error boundaries catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them.  Note Error boundaries do not catch errors for:  Event handlers (learn more) Asynchronous code (e.g. setTimeout or requestAnimationFrame callbacks) Server side rendering Errors thrown in the error boundary itself (rather than its children)   A class component becomes an error boundary if it defines either (or both) of the lifecycle methods static getDerivedStateFromError() or componentDidCatch(). Use static getDerivedStateFromError() to render a fallback UI after an error has been thrown. Use componentDidCatch() to log error information. class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }
  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
    return { hasError: true };
  }
  componentDidCatch(error, errorInfo) {
    // You can also log the error to an error reporting service
    logErrorToMyService(error, errorInfo);
  }
  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // You can render any custom fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }
    return this.props.children; 
  }
} Then you can use it as a regular component: <ErrorBoundary>
  <MyWidget />
</ErrorBoundary> Error boundaries work like a JavaScript catch {} block, but for components. Only class components can be error boundaries. In practice, most of the time you’ll want to declare an error boundary component once and use it throughout your application. Note that error boundaries only catch errors in the components below them in the tree. An error boundary can’t catch an error within itself. If an error boundary fails trying to render the error message, the error will propagate to the closest error boundary above it. This, too, is similar to how the catch {} block works in JavaScript. Live Demo  Check out this example of declaring and using an error boundary with React 16. Where to Place Error Boundaries  The granularity of error boundaries is up to you. You may wrap top-level route components to display a “Something went wrong” message to the user, just like how server-side frameworks often handle crashes. You may also wrap individual widgets in an error boundary to protect them from crashing the rest of the application. New Behavior for Uncaught Errors  This change has an important implication. As of React 16, errors that were not caught by any error boundary will result in unmounting of the whole React component tree. We debated this decision, but in our experience it is worse to leave corrupted UI in place than to completely remove it. For example, in a product like Messenger leaving the broken UI visible could lead to somebody sending a message to the wrong person. Similarly, it is worse for a payments app to display a wrong amount than to render nothing. This change means that as you migrate to React 16, you will likely uncover existing crashes in your application that have been unnoticed before. Adding error boundaries lets you provide better user experience when something goes wrong. For example, Facebook Messenger wraps content of the sidebar, the info panel, the conversation log, and the message input into separate error boundaries. If some component in one of these UI areas crashes, the rest of them remain interactive. We also encourage you to use JS error reporting services (or build your own) so that you can learn about unhandled exceptions as they happen in production, and fix them. Component Stack Traces  React 16 prints all errors that occurred during rendering to the console in development, even if the application accidentally swallows them. In addition to the error message and the JavaScript stack, it also provides component stack traces. Now you can see where exactly in the component tree the failure has happened:    You can also see the filenames and line numbers in the component stack trace. This works by default in Create React App projects:    If you don’t use Create React App, you can add this plugin manually to your Babel configuration. Note that it’s intended only for development and must be disabled in production.  Note Component names displayed in the stack traces depend on the Function.name property. If you support older browsers and devices which may not yet provide this natively (e.g. IE 11), consider including a Function.name polyfill in your bundled application, such as function.name-polyfill. Alternatively, you may explicitly set the displayName property on all your components.  How About try/catch?  try / catch is great but it only works for imperative code: try {
  showButton();
} catch (error) {
  // ...
} However, React components are declarative and specify what should be rendered: <Button /> Error boundaries preserve the declarative nature of React, and behave as you would expect. For example, even if an error occurs in a componentDidUpdate method caused by a setState somewhere deep in the tree, it will still correctly propagate to the closest error boundary. How About Event Handlers?  Error boundaries do not catch errors inside event handlers. React doesn’t need error boundaries to recover from errors in event handlers. Unlike the render method and lifecycle methods, the event handlers don’t happen during rendering. So if they throw, React still knows what to display on the screen. If you need to catch an error inside an event handler, use the regular JavaScript try / catch statement: class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { error: null };
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }
  handleClick() {
    try {
      // Do something that could throw
    } catch (error) {
      this.setState({ error });
    }
  }
  render() {
    if (this.state.error) {
      return <h1>Caught an error.</h1>
    }
    return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
  }
} Note that the above example is demonstrating regular JavaScript behavior and doesn’t use error boundaries. Naming Changes from React 15  React 15 included a very limited support for error boundaries under a different method name: unstable_handleError. This method no longer works, and you will need to change it to componentDidCatch in your code starting from the first 16 beta release. For this change, we’ve provided a codemod to automatically migrate your code.

-----------------------------------------------------------
SyntheticEvent
This reference guide documents the SyntheticEvent wrapper that forms part of React’s Event System. See the Handling Events guide to learn more. Overview  Your event handlers will be passed instances of SyntheticEvent, a cross-browser wrapper around the browser’s native event. It has the same interface as the browser’s native event, including stopPropagation() and preventDefault(), except the events work identically across all browsers.  If you find that you need the underlying browser event for some reason, simply use the nativeEvent attribute to get it. The synthetic events are different from, and do not map directly to, the browser’s native events. For example in onMouseLeave event.nativeEvent will point to a mouseout event. The specific mapping is not part of the public API and may change at any time. Every SyntheticEvent object has the following attributes: boolean bubbles
boolean cancelable
DOMEventTarget currentTarget
boolean defaultPrevented
number eventPhase
boolean isTrusted
DOMEvent nativeEvent
void preventDefault()
boolean isDefaultPrevented()
void stopPropagation()
boolean isPropagationStopped()
void persist()
DOMEventTarget target
number timeStamp
string type  Note: As of v17, e.persist() doesn’t do anything because the SyntheticEvent is no longer pooled.   Note: As of v0.14, returning false from an event handler will no longer stop event propagation. Instead, e.stopPropagation() or e.preventDefault() should be triggered manually, as appropriate.  Supported Events  React normalizes events so that they have consistent properties across different browsers. The event handlers below are triggered by an event in the bubbling phase. To register an event handler for the capture phase, append Capture to the event name; for example, instead of using onClick, you would use onClickCapture to handle the click event in the capture phase.

number which The key property can take any of the values documented in the DOM Level 3 Events spec. Focus Events  Event names: onFocus onBlur These focus events work on all elements in the React DOM, not just form elements. Properties: DOMEventTarget relatedTarget onFocus  The onFocus event is called when the element (or some element inside of it) receives focus. For example, it’s called when the user clicks on a text input. function Example() {
  return (
    <input
      onFocus={(e) => {
        console.log('Focused on input');
      }}
      placeholder="onFocus is triggered when you click this input."
    />
  )
} onBlur  The onBlur event handler is called when focus has left the element (or left some element inside of it). For example, it’s called when the user clicks outside of a focused text input. function Example() {
  return (
    <input
      onBlur={(e) => {
        console.log('Triggered because this input lost focus');
      }}
      placeholder="onBlur is triggered when you click this input and then you click outside of it."
    />
  )
} Detecting Focus Entering and Leaving  You can use the currentTarget and relatedTarget to differentiate if the focusing or blurring events originated from outside of the parent element. Here is a demo you can copy and paste that shows how to detect focusing a child, focusing the element itself, and focus entering or leaving the whole subtree. function Example() {
  return (
    <div
      tabIndex={1}
      onFocus={(e) => {
        if (e.currentTarget === e.target) {
          console.log('focused self');
        } else {
          console.log('focused child', e.target);
        }
        if (!e.currentTarget.contains(e.relatedTarget)) {
          // Not triggered when swapping focus between children
          console.log('focus entered self');
        }
      }}
      onBlur={(e) => {
        if (e.currentTarget === e.target) {
          console.log('unfocused self');
        } else {
          console.log('unfocused child', e.target);
        }
        if (!e.currentTarget.contains(e.relatedTarget)) {
          // Not triggered when swapping focus between children
          console.log('focus left self');
        }
      }}
    >
      <input id="1" />
      <input id="2" />
    </div>
  );

boolean isPrimary A note on cross-browser support: Pointer events are not yet supported in every browser (at the time of writing this article, supported browsers include: Chrome, Firefox, Edge, and Internet Explorer). React deliberately does not polyfill support for other browsers because a standard-conform polyfill would significantly increase the bundle size of react-dom. If your application requires pointer events, we recommend adding a third party pointer event polyfill.

-----------------------------------------------------------
AJAX and APIs
How can I make an AJAX call?  You can use any AJAX library you like with React. Some popular ones are Axios, jQuery AJAX, and the browser built-in window.fetch. Where in the component lifecycle should I make an AJAX call?  You should populate data with AJAX calls in the componentDidMount lifecycle method. This is so you can use setState to update your component when the data is retrieved. Example: Using AJAX results to set local state  The component below demonstrates how to make an AJAX call in componentDidMount to populate local component state.  The example API returns a JSON object like this: {
  "items": [
    { "id": 1, "name": "Apples",  "price": "$2" },
    { "id": 2, "name": "Peaches", "price": "$5" }
  ] 
} class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      error: null,
      isLoaded: false,
      items: []
    };
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    fetch("https://api.example.com/items")
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(
        (result) => {
          this.setState({
            isLoaded: true,
            items: result.items
          });
        },
        // Note: it's important to handle errors here
        // instead of a catch() block so that we don't swallow
        // exceptions from actual bugs in components.
        (error) => {
          this.setState({
            isLoaded: true,
            error
          });
        }
      )
  }
  render() {
    const { error, isLoaded, items } = this.state;
    if (error) {
      return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
    } else if (!isLoaded) {
      return <div>Loading...</div>;
    } else {
      return (
        <ul>
          {items.map(item => (
            <li key={item.id}>
              {item.name} {item.price}
            </li>
          ))}
        </ul>
      );
    }
  }
} Here is the equivalent with Hooks:  function MyComponent() {
  const [error, setError] = useState(null);
  const [isLoaded, setIsLoaded] = useState(false);
  const [items, setItems] = useState([]);
  // Note: the empty deps array [] means
  // this useEffect will run once
  // similar to componentDidMount()
  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://api.example.com/items")
      .then(res => res.json())
      .then(
        (result) => {
          setIsLoaded(true);
          setItems(result);
        },
        // Note: it's important to handle errors here
        // instead of a catch() block so that we don't swallow
        // exceptions from actual bugs in components.
        (error) => {
          setIsLoaded(true);
          setError(error);
        }
      )
  }, [])
  if (error) {
    return <div>Error: {error.message}</div>;
  } else if (!isLoaded) {
    return <div>Loading...</div>;
  } else {
    return (
      <ul>
        {items.map(item => (
          <li key={item.id}>
            {item.name} {item.price}
          </li>
        ))}
      </ul>
    );
  }
}

-----------------------------------------------------------
Passing Functions to Components
How do I pass an event handler (like onClick) to a component?  Pass event handlers and other functions as props to child components: <button onClick={this.handleClick}> If you need to have access to the parent component in the handler, you also need to bind the function to the component instance (see below). How do I bind a function to a component instance?  There are several ways to make sure functions have access to component attributes like this.props and this.state, depending on which syntax and build steps you are using. Bind in Constructor (ES2015)  class Foo extends Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }
  handleClick() {
    console.log('Click happened');
  }
  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
  }
} Class Properties (Stage 3 Proposal)  class Foo extends Component {
  // Note: this syntax is experimental and not standardized yet.
  handleClick = () => {
    console.log('Click happened');
  }
  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>;
  }
} Bind in Render  class Foo extends Component {
  handleClick() {
    console.log('Click happened');
  }
  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this)}>Click Me</button>;
  }
}  Note: Using Function.prototype.bind in render creates a new function each time the component renders, which may have performance implications (see below).  Arrow Function in Render  class Foo extends Component {
  handleClick() {
    console.log('Click happened');
  }
  render() {
    return <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>Click Me</button>;
  }
}  Note: Using an arrow function in render creates a new function each time the component renders, which may break optimizations based on strict identity comparison.  Is it OK to use arrow functions in render methods?  Generally speaking, yes, it is OK, and it is often the easiest way to pass parameters to callback functions. If you do have performance issues, by all means, optimize! Why is binding necessary at all?  In JavaScript, these two code snippets are not equivalent: obj.method(); var method = obj.method;
method(); Binding methods helps ensure that the second snippet works the same way as the first one. With React, typically you only need to bind the methods you pass to other components. For example, <button onClick={this.handleClick}> passes this.handleClick so you want to bind it. However, it is unnecessary to bind the render method or the lifecycle methods: we don’t pass them to other components. This post by Yehuda Katz explains what binding is, and how functions work in JavaScript, in detail. Why is my function being called every time the component renders?  Make sure you aren’t calling the function when you pass it to the component: render() {
  // Wrong: handleClick is called instead of passed as a reference!
  return <button onClick={this.handleClick()}>Click Me</button>
} Instead, pass the function itself (without parens): render() {
  // Correct: handleClick is passed as a reference!
  return <button onClick={this.handleClick}>Click Me</button>
} How do I pass a parameter to an event handler or callback?  You can use an arrow function to wrap around an event handler and pass parameters: <button onClick={() => this.handleClick(id)} /> This is equivalent to calling .bind: <button onClick={this.handleClick.bind(this, id)} /> Example: Passing params using arrow functions  const A = 65 // ASCII character code
class Alphabet extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      justClicked: null,
      letters: Array.from({length: 26}, (_, i) => String.fromCharCode(A + i))
    };
  }
  handleClick(letter) {
    this.setState({ justClicked: letter });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        Just clicked: {this.state.justClicked}
        <ul>
          {this.state.letters.map(letter =>
            <li key={letter} onClick={() => this.handleClick(letter)}>
              {letter}
            </li>
          )}
        </ul>
      </div>
    )
  }
} Example: Passing params using data-attributes  Alternately, you can use DOM APIs to store data needed for event handlers. Consider this approach if you need to optimize a large number of elements or have a render tree that relies on React.PureComponent equality checks. const A = 65 // ASCII character code
class Alphabet extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
    this.state = {
      justClicked: null,
      letters: Array.from({length: 26}, (_, i) => String.fromCharCode(A + i))
    };
  }
  handleClick(e) {
    this.setState({
      justClicked: e.target.dataset.letter
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        Just clicked: {this.state.justClicked}
        <ul>
          {this.state.letters.map(letter =>
            <li key={letter} data-letter={letter} onClick={this.handleClick}>
              {letter}
            </li>
          )}
        </ul>
      </div>
    )
  }
} How can I prevent a function from being called too quickly or too many times in a row?  If you have an event handler such as onClick or onScroll and want to prevent the callback from being fired too quickly, then you can limit the rate at which callback is executed. This can be done by using:  
throttling: sample changes based on a time based frequency (eg _.throttle) 
debouncing: publish changes after a period of inactivity (eg _.debounce) 
requestAnimationFrame throttling: sample changes based on requestAnimationFrame (eg raf-schd)  See this visualization for a comparison of throttle and debounce functions.  Note: _.debounce, _.throttle and raf-schd provide a cancel method to cancel delayed callbacks. You should either call this method from componentWillUnmount or check to ensure that the component is still mounted within the delayed function.  Throttle  Throttling prevents a function from being called more than once in a given window of time. The example below throttles a “click” handler to prevent calling it more than once per second. import throttle from 'lodash.throttle';
class LoadMoreButton extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
    this.handleClickThrottled = throttle(this.handleClick, 1000);
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.handleClickThrottled.cancel();
  }
  render() {
    return <button onClick={this.handleClickThrottled}>Load More</button>;
  }
  handleClick() {
    this.props.loadMore();
  }
} Debounce  Debouncing ensures that a function will not be executed until after a certain amount of time has passed since it was last called. This can be useful when you have to perform some expensive calculation in response to an event that might dispatch rapidly (eg scroll or keyboard events). The example below debounces text input with a 250ms delay. import debounce from 'lodash.debounce';
class Searchbox extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.emitChangeDebounced = debounce(this.emitChange, 250);
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.emitChangeDebounced.cancel();
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <input
        type="text"
        onChange={this.handleChange}
        placeholder="Search..."
        defaultValue={this.props.value}
      />
    );
  }
  handleChange(e) {
    this.emitChangeDebounced(e.target.value);
  }
  emitChange(value) {
    this.props.onChange(value);
  }
} 
requestAnimationFrame throttling  requestAnimationFrame is a way of queuing a function to be executed in the browser at the optimal time for rendering performance. A function that is queued with requestAnimationFrame will fire in the next frame. The browser will work hard to ensure that there are 60 frames per second (60 fps). However, if the browser is unable to it will naturally limit the amount of frames in a second. For example, a device might only be able to handle 30 fps and so you will only get 30 frames in that second. Using requestAnimationFrame for throttling is a useful technique in that it prevents you from doing more than 60 updates in a second. If you are doing 100 updates in a second this creates additional work for the browser that the user will not see anyway.  Note: Using this technique will only capture the last published value in a frame. You can see an example of how this optimization works on MDN  import rafSchedule from 'raf-schd';
class ScrollListener extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleScroll = this.handleScroll.bind(this);
    // Create a new function to schedule updates.
    this.scheduleUpdate = rafSchedule(
      point => this.props.onScroll(point)
    );
  }
  handleScroll(e) {
    // When we receive a scroll event, schedule an update.
    // If we receive many updates within a frame, we'll only publish the latest value.
    this.scheduleUpdate({ x: e.clientX, y: e.clientY });
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    // Cancel any pending updates since we're unmounting.
    this.scheduleUpdate.cancel();
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div
        style={{ overflow: 'scroll' }}
        onScroll={this.handleScroll}
      >
        <img src="/my-huge-image.jpg" />
      </div>
    );
  }
} Testing your rate limiting  When testing your rate limiting code works correctly it is helpful to have the ability to fast forward time. If you are using jest then you can use mock timers to fast forward time. If you are using requestAnimationFrame throttling then you may find raf-stub to be a useful tool to control the ticking of animation frames.

Virtual DOM and Internals
What is the Virtual DOM?  The virtual DOM (VDOM) is a programming concept where an ideal, or “virtual”, representation of a UI is kept in memory and synced with the “real” DOM by a library such as ReactDOM. This process is called reconciliation. This approach enables the declarative API of React: You tell React what state you want the UI to be in, and it makes sure the DOM matches that state. This abstracts out the attribute manipulation, event handling, and manual DOM updating that you would otherwise have to use to build your app. Since “virtual DOM” is more of a pattern than a specific technology, people sometimes say it to mean different things. In React world, the term “virtual DOM” is usually associated with React elements since they are the objects representing the user interface. React, however, also uses internal objects called “fibers” to hold additional information about the component tree. They may also be considered a part of “virtual DOM” implementation in React. Is the Shadow DOM the same as the Virtual DOM?  No, they are different. The Shadow DOM is a browser technology designed primarily for scoping variables and CSS in web components. The virtual DOM is a concept implemented by libraries in JavaScript on top of browser APIs. What is “React Fiber”?  Fiber is the new reconciliation engine in React 16. Its main goal is to enable incremental rendering of the virtual DOM. Read more.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Component State
What does setState do?  setState() schedules an update to a component’s state object. When state changes, the component responds by re-rendering. What is the difference between state and props?  props (short for “properties”) and state are both plain JavaScript objects. While both hold information that influences the output of render, they are different in one important way: props get passed to the component (similar to function parameters) whereas state is managed within the component (similar to variables declared within a function). Here are some good resources for further reading on when to use props vs state:  Props vs State ReactJS: Props vs. State  Why is setState giving me the wrong value?  In React, both this.props and this.state represent the rendered values, i.e. what’s currently on the screen. Calls to setState are asynchronous - don’t rely on this.state to reflect the new value immediately after calling setState. Pass an updater function instead of an object if you need to compute values based on the current state (see below for details). Example of code that will not behave as expected: incrementCount() {
  // Note: this will *not* work as intended.
  this.setState({count: this.state.count + 1});
}
handleSomething() {
  // Let's say `this.state.count` starts at 0.
  this.incrementCount();
  this.incrementCount();
  this.incrementCount();
  // When React re-renders the component, `this.state.count` will be 1, but you expected 3.
  // This is because `incrementCount()` function above reads from `this.state.count`,
  // but React doesn't update `this.state.count` until the component is re-rendered.
  // So `incrementCount()` ends up reading `this.state.count` as 0 every time, and sets it to 1.
  // The fix is described below!
} See below for how to fix this problem. How do I update state with values that depend on the current state?  Pass a function instead of an object to setState to ensure the call always uses the most updated version of state (see below).  What is the difference between passing an object or a function in setState?  Passing an update function allows you to access the current state value inside the updater. Since setState calls are batched, this lets you chain updates and ensure they build on top of each other instead of conflicting: incrementCount() {
  this.setState((state) => {
    // Important: read `state` instead of `this.state` when updating.
    return {count: state.count + 1}
  });
}
handleSomething() {
  // Let's say `this.state.count` starts at 0.
  this.incrementCount();
  this.incrementCount();
  this.incrementCount();
  // If you read `this.state.count` now, it would still be 0.
  // But when React re-renders the component, it will be 3.
} Learn more about setState When is setState asynchronous?  Currently, setState is asynchronous inside event handlers. This ensures, for example, that if both Parent and Child call setState during a click event, Child isn’t re-rendered twice. Instead, React “flushes” the state updates at the end of the browser event. This results in significant performance improvements in larger apps. This is an implementation detail so avoid relying on it directly. In the future versions, React will batch updates by default in more cases. Why doesn’t React update this.state synchronously?  As explained in the previous section, React intentionally “waits” until all components call setState() in their event handlers before starting to re-render. This boosts performance by avoiding unnecessary re-renders. However, you might still be wondering why React doesn’t just update this.state immediately without re-rendering. There are two main reasons:  This would break the consistency between props and state, causing issues that are very hard to debug. This would make some of the new features we’re working on impossible to implement.  This GitHub comment dives deep into the specific examples. Should I use a state management library like Redux or MobX?  Maybe. It’s a good idea to get to know React first, before adding in additional libraries. You can build quite complex applications using only React.

faq-structure
-----------------------------------------------------------
File Structure
Is there a recommended way to structure React projects?  React doesn’t have opinions on how you put files into folders. That said there are a few common approaches popular in the ecosystem you may want to consider. Grouping by features or routes  One common way to structure projects is to locate CSS, JS, and tests together inside folders grouped by feature or route. common/
  Avatar.js
  Avatar.css
  APIUtils.js
  APIUtils.test.js
feed/
  index.js
  Feed.js
  Feed.css
  FeedStory.js
  FeedStory.test.js
  FeedAPI.js
profile/
  index.js
  Profile.js
  ProfileHeader.js
  ProfileHeader.css
  ProfileAPI.js The definition of a “feature” is not universal, and it is up to you to choose the granularity. If you can’t come up with a list of top-level folders, you can ask the users of your product what major parts it consists of, and use their mental model as a blueprint. Grouping by file type  Another popular way to structure projects is to group similar files together, for example: api/
  APIUtils.js
  APIUtils.test.js
  ProfileAPI.js
  UserAPI.js
components/
  Avatar.js
  Avatar.css
  Feed.js
  Feed.css
  FeedStory.js
  FeedStory.test.js
  Profile.js
  ProfileHeader.js
  ProfileHeader.css Some people also prefer to go further, and separate components into different folders depending on their role in the application. For example, Atomic Design is a design methodology built on this principle. Remember that it’s often more productive to treat such methodologies as helpful examples rather than strict rules to follow. Avoid too much nesting  There are many pain points associated with deep directory nesting in JavaScript projects. It becomes harder to write relative imports between them, or to update those imports when the files are moved. Unless you have a very compelling reason to use a deep folder structure, consider limiting yourself to a maximum of three or four nested folders within a single project. Of course, this is only a recommendation, and it may not be relevant to your project. Don’t overthink it  If you’re just starting a project, don’t spend more than five minutes on choosing a file structure. Pick any of the above approaches (or come up with your own) and start writing code! You’ll likely want to rethink it anyway after you’ve written some real code. If you feel completely stuck, start by keeping all files in a single folder. Eventually it will grow large enough that you will want to separate some files from the rest. By that time you’ll have enough knowledge to tell which files you edit together most often. In general, it is a good idea to keep files that often change together close to each other. This principle is called “colocation”. As projects grow larger, they often use a mix of both of the above approaches in practice. So choosing the “right” one in the beginning isn’t very important.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Styling and CSS
How do I add CSS classes to components?  Pass a string as the className prop: render() {
  return <span className="menu navigation-menu">Menu</span>
} It is common for CSS classes to depend on the component props or state: render() {
  let className = 'menu';
  if (this.props.isActive) {
    className += ' menu-active';
  }
  return <span className={className}>Menu</span>
}  Tip If you often find yourself writing code like this, classnames package can simplify it.  Can I use inline styles?  Yes, see the docs on styling here. Are inline styles bad?  CSS classes are generally better for performance than inline styles. What is CSS-in-JS?  “CSS-in-JS” refers to a pattern where CSS is composed using JavaScript instead of defined in external files. Note that this functionality is not a part of React, but provided by third-party libraries. React does not have an opinion about how styles are defined; if in doubt, a good starting point is to define your styles in a separate *.css file as usual and refer to them using className. Can I do animations in React?  React can be used to power animations. See React Transition Group, React Motion, React Spring, or Framer Motion, for example.

faq-versioning
-----------------------------------------------------------
Versioning Policy
React follows semantic versioning (semver) principles. That means that with a version number x.y.z:  When releasing critical bug fixes, we make a patch release by changing the z number (ex: 15.6.2 to 15.6.3). When releasing new features or non-critical fixes, we make a minor release by changing the y number (ex: 15.6.2 to 15.7.0). When releasing breaking changes, we make a major release by changing the x number (ex: 15.6.2 to 16.0.0).  Major releases can also contain new features, and any release can include bug fixes. Minor releases are the most common type of release.  This versioning policy does not apply to prerelease builds in the Next or Experimental channels. Learn more about prereleases.  Breaking Changes  Breaking changes are inconvenient for everyone, so we try to minimize the number of major releases – for example, React 15 was released in April 2016 and React 16 was released in September 2017, and React 17 was released in October 2020. Instead, we release new features in minor versions. That means that minor releases are often more interesting and compelling than majors, despite their unassuming name. Commitment to Stability  As we change React over time, we try to minimize the effort required to take advantage of new features. When possible, we’ll keep an older API working, even if that means putting it in a separate package. For example, mixins have been discouraged for years but they’re supported to this day via create-react-class and many codebases continue to use them in stable, legacy code. Over a million developers use React, collectively maintaining millions of components. The Facebook codebase alone has over 50,000 React components. That means we need to make it as easy as possible to upgrade to new versions of React; if we make large changes without a migration path, people will be stuck on old versions. We test these upgrade paths on Facebook itself – if our team of less than 10 people can update 50,000+ components alone, we hope the upgrade will be manageable for anyone using React. In many cases, we write automated scripts to upgrade component syntax, which we then include in the open-source release for everyone to use. Gradual Upgrades via Warnings  Development builds of React include many helpful warnings. Whenever possible, we add warnings in preparation for future breaking changes. That way, if your app has no warnings on the latest release, it will be compatible with the next major release. This allows you to upgrade your apps one component at a time. Development warnings won’t affect the runtime behavior of your app. That way, you can feel confident that your app will behave the same way between the development and production builds — the only differences are that the production build won’t log the warnings and that it is more efficient. (If you ever notice otherwise, please file an issue.) What Counts as a Breaking Change?  In general, we don’t bump the major version number for changes to:  
Development warnings. Since these don’t affect production behavior, we may add new warnings or modify existing warnings in between major versions. In fact, this is what allows us to reliably warn about upcoming breaking changes. 
APIs starting with unstable_. These are provided as experimental features whose APIs we are not yet confident in. By releasing these with an unstable_ prefix, we can iterate faster and get to a stable API sooner. 
Alpha and canary versions of React. We provide alpha versions of React as a way to test new features early, but we need the flexibility to make changes based on what we learn in the alpha period. If you use these versions, note that APIs may change before the stable release. 
Undocumented APIs and internal data structures. If you access internal property names like __SECRET_INTERNALS_DO_NOT_USE_OR_YOU_WILL_BE_FIRED or __reactInternalInstance$uk43rzhitjg, there is no warranty. You are on your own.  This policy is designed to be pragmatic: certainly, we don’t want to cause headaches for you. If we bumped the major version for all of these changes, we would end up releasing more major versions and ultimately causing more versioning pain for the community. It would also mean that we can’t make progress in improving React as fast as we’d like. That said, if we expect that a change on this list will cause broad problems in the community, we will still do our best to provide a gradual migration path. If a Minor Release Includes No New Features, Why Isn’t It a Patch?  It’s possible that a minor release will not include new features. This is allowed by semver, which states ”[a minor version] MAY be incremented if substantial new functionality or improvements are introduced within the private code. It MAY include patch level changes.” However, it does raise the question of why these releases aren’t versioned as patches instead. The answer is that any change to React (or other software) carries some risk of breaking in unexpected ways. Imagine a scenario where a patch release that fixes one bug accidentally introduces a different bug. This would not only be disruptive to developers, but also harm their confidence in future patch releases. It’s especially regrettable if the original fix is for a bug that is rarely encountered in practice. We have a pretty good track record for keeping React releases free of bugs, but patch releases have an even higher bar for reliability because most developers assume they can be adopted without adverse consequences. For these reasons, we reserve patch releases only for the most critical bugs and security vulnerabilities. If a release includes non-essential changes — such as internal refactors, changes to implementation details, performance improvements, or minor bugfixes — we will bump the minor version even when there are no new features.

forms
-----------------------------------------------------------
Forms
HTML form elements work a bit differently from other DOM elements in React, because form elements naturally keep some internal state. For example, this form in plain HTML accepts a single name: <form>
  <label>
    Name:
    <input type="text" name="name" />
  </label>
  <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
</form> This form has the default HTML form behavior of browsing to a new page when the user submits the form. If you want this behavior in React, it just works. But in most cases, it’s convenient to have a JavaScript function that handles the submission of the form and has access to the data that the user entered into the form. The standard way to achieve this is with a technique called “controlled components”. Controlled Components  In HTML, form elements such as <input>, <textarea>, and <select> typically maintain their own state and update it based on user input. In React, mutable state is typically kept in the state property of components, and only updated with setState(). We can combine the two by making the React state be the “single source of truth”. Then the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input. An input form element whose value is controlled by React in this way is called a “controlled component”. For example, if we want to make the previous example log the name when it is submitted, we can write the form as a controlled component: class NameForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {value: ''};
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({value: event.target.value});
  }
  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Name:
          <input type="text" value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
} Try it on CodePen Since the value attribute is set on our form element, the displayed value will always be this.state.value, making the React state the source of truth. Since handleChange runs on every keystroke to update the React state, the displayed value will update as the user types. With a controlled component, the input’s value is always driven by the React state. While this means you have to type a bit more code, you can now pass the value to other UI elements too, or reset it from other event handlers. The textarea Tag  In HTML, a <textarea> element defines its text by its children: <textarea>
  Hello there, this is some text in a text area
</textarea> In React, a <textarea> uses a value attribute instead. This way, a form using a <textarea> can be written very similarly to a form that uses a single-line input: class EssayForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      value: 'Please write an essay about your favorite DOM element.'
    };
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({value: event.target.value});
  }
  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert('An essay was submitted: ' + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Essay:
          <textarea value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange} />
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
} Notice that this.state.value is initialized in the constructor, so that the text area starts off with some text in it. The select Tag  In HTML, <select> creates a drop-down list. For example, this HTML creates a drop-down list of flavors: <select>
  <option value="grapefruit">Grapefruit</option>
  <option value="lime">Lime</option>
  <option selected value="coconut">Coconut</option>
  <option value="mango">Mango</option>
</select> Note that the Coconut option is initially selected, because of the selected attribute. React, instead of using this selected attribute, uses a value attribute on the root select tag. This is more convenient in a controlled component because you only need to update it in one place. For example: class FlavorForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {value: 'coconut'};
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(event) {
    this.setState({value: event.target.value});
  }
  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert('Your favorite flavor is: ' + this.state.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Pick your favorite flavor:
          <select value={this.state.value} onChange={this.handleChange}>
            <option value="grapefruit">Grapefruit</option>
            <option value="lime">Lime</option>
            <option value="coconut">Coconut</option>
            <option value="mango">Mango</option>
          </select>
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
} Try it on CodePen Overall, this makes it so that <input type="text">, <textarea>, and <select> all work very similarly - they all accept a value attribute that you can use to implement a controlled component.  Note You can pass an array into the value attribute, allowing you to select multiple options in a select tag: <select multiple={true} value={['B', 'C']}>  The file input Tag  In HTML, an <input type="file"> lets the user choose one or more files from their device storage to be uploaded to a server or manipulated by JavaScript via the File API. <input type="file" /> Because its value is read-only, it is an uncontrolled component in React. It is discussed together with other uncontrolled components later in the documentation. Handling Multiple Inputs  When you need to handle multiple controlled input elements, you can add a name attribute to each element and let the handler function choose what to do based on the value of event.target.name. For example: class Reservation extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      isGoing: true,
      numberOfGuests: 2
    };
    this.handleInputChange = this.handleInputChange.bind(this);
  }
  handleInputChange(event) {
    const target = event.target;
    const value = target.type === 'checkbox' ? target.checked : target.value;
    const name = target.name;
    this.setState({
      [name]: value
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <form>
        <label>
          Is going:
          <input
            name="isGoing"            type="checkbox"
            checked={this.state.isGoing}
            onChange={this.handleInputChange} />
        </label>
        <br />
        <label>
          Number of guests:
          <input
            name="numberOfGuests"            type="number"
            value={this.state.numberOfGuests}
            onChange={this.handleInputChange} />
        </label>
      </form>
    );
  }
} Try it on CodePen Note how we used the ES6 computed property name syntax to update the state key corresponding to the given input name: this.setState({
  [name]: value
}); It is equivalent to this ES5 code: var partialState = {};
partialState[name] = value;
this.setState(partialState); Also, since setState() automatically merges a partial state into the current state, we only needed to call it with the changed parts. Controlled Input Null Value  Specifying the value prop on a controlled component prevents the user from changing the input unless you desire so. If you’ve specified a value but the input is still editable, you may have accidentally set value to undefined or null. The following code demonstrates this. (The input is locked at first but becomes editable after a short delay.) ReactDOM.render(<input value="hi" />, mountNode);
setTimeout(function() {
  ReactDOM.render(<input value={null} />, mountNode);
}, 1000); Alternatives to Controlled Components  It can sometimes be tedious to use controlled components, because you need to write an event handler for every way your data can change and pipe all of the input state through a React component. This can become particularly annoying when you are converting a preexisting codebase to React, or integrating a React application with a non-React library. In these situations, you might want to check out uncontrolled components, an alternative technique for implementing input forms. Fully-Fledged Solutions  If you’re looking for a complete solution including validation, keeping track of the visited fields, and handling form submission, Formik is one of the popular choices. However, it is built on the same principles of controlled components and managing state — so don’t neglect to learn them.

forwarding-refs
-----------------------------------------------------------
Forwarding Refs
Ref forwarding is a technique for automatically passing a ref through a component to one of its children. This is typically not necessary for most components in the application. However, it can be useful for some kinds of components, especially in reusable component libraries. The most common scenarios are described below. Forwarding refs to DOM components  Consider a FancyButton component that renders the native button DOM element: 
function FancyButton(props) {
  return (
    <button className="FancyButton">
      {props.children}
    </button>
  );
} React components hide their implementation details, including their rendered output. Other components using FancyButton usually will not need to obtain a ref to the inner button DOM element. This is good because it prevents components from relying on each other’s DOM structure too much. Although such encapsulation is desirable for application-level components like FeedStory or Comment, it can be inconvenient for highly reusable “leaf” components like FancyButton or MyTextInput. These components tend to be used throughout the application in a similar manner as a regular DOM button and input, and accessing their DOM nodes may be unavoidable for managing focus, selection, or animations. Ref forwarding is an opt-in feature that lets some components take a ref they receive, and pass it further down (in other words, “forward” it) to a child. In the example below, FancyButton uses React.forwardRef to obtain the ref passed to it, and then forward it to the DOM button that it renders:
const FancyButton = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (
  <button ref={ref} className="FancyButton">
    {props.children}
  </button>
));
// You can now get a ref directly to the DOM button:
const ref = React.createRef();
<FancyButton ref={ref}>Click me!</FancyButton>; This way, components using FancyButton can get a ref to the underlying button DOM node and access it if necessary—just like if they used a DOM button directly. Here is a step-by-step explanation of what happens in the above example:  We create a React ref by calling React.createRef and assign it to a ref variable. We pass our ref down to <FancyButton ref={ref}> by specifying it as a JSX attribute. React passes the ref to the (props, ref) => ... function inside forwardRef as a second argument. We forward this ref argument down to <button ref={ref}> by specifying it as a JSX attribute. When the ref is attached, ref.current will point to the <button> DOM node.   Note The second ref argument only exists when you define a component with React.forwardRef call. Regular function or class components don’t receive the ref argument, and ref is not available in props either. Ref forwarding is not limited to DOM components. You can forward refs to class component instances, too.  Note for component library maintainers  When you start using forwardRef in a component library, you should treat it as a breaking change and release a new major version of your library. This is because your library likely has an observably different behavior (such as what refs get assigned to, and what types are exported), and this can break apps and other libraries that depend on the old behavior. Conditionally applying React.forwardRef when it exists is also not recommended for the same reasons: it changes how your library behaves and can break your users’ apps when they upgrade React itself. Forwarding refs in higher-order components  This technique can also be particularly useful with higher-order components (also known as HOCs). Let’s start with an example HOC that logs component props to the console: 
function logProps(WrappedComponent) {
  class LogProps extends React.Component {
    componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
      console.log('old props:', prevProps);
      console.log('new props:', this.props);
    }
    render() {
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  }
  return LogProps;
} The “logProps” HOC passes all props through to the component it wraps, so the rendered output will be the same. For example, we can use this HOC to log all props that get passed to our “fancy button” component: 
class FancyButton extends React.Component {
  focus() {
    // ...
  }
  // ...
}
// Rather than exporting FancyButton, we export LogProps.
// It will render a FancyButton though.
export default logProps(FancyButton);
 There is one caveat to the above example: refs will not get passed through. That’s because ref is not a prop. Like key, it’s handled differently by React. If you add a ref to a HOC, the ref will refer to the outermost container component, not the wrapped component. This means that refs intended for our FancyButton component will actually be attached to the LogProps component: 
import FancyButton from './FancyButton';
const ref = React.createRef();
// The FancyButton component we imported is the LogProps HOC.
// Even though the rendered output will be the same,
// Our ref will point to LogProps instead of the inner FancyButton component!
// This means we can't call e.g. ref.current.focus()
<FancyButton
  label="Click Me"
  handleClick={handleClick}
  ref={ref}/>; Fortunately, we can explicitly forward refs to the inner FancyButton component using the React.forwardRef API. React.forwardRef accepts a render function that receives props and ref parameters and returns a React node. For example: 
function logProps(Component) {
  class LogProps extends React.Component {
    componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
      console.log('old props:', prevProps);
      console.log('new props:', this.props);
    }
    render() {
      const {forwardedRef, ...rest} = this.props;
      // Assign the custom prop "forwardedRef" as a ref
      return <Component ref={forwardedRef} {...rest} />;
    }
  }
  // Note the second param "ref" provided by React.forwardRef.
  // We can pass it along to LogProps as a regular prop, e.g. "forwardedRef"
  // And it can then be attached to the Component.
  return React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
    return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;
  });
} Displaying a custom name in DevTools  React.forwardRef accepts a render function. React DevTools uses this function to determine what to display for the ref forwarding component. For example, the following component will appear as ”ForwardRef” in the DevTools:
const WrappedComponent = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => {
  return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;
}); If you name the render function, DevTools will also include its name (e.g. ”ForwardRef(myFunction)”):
const WrappedComponent = React.forwardRef(
  function myFunction(props, ref) {
    return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;
  }
); You can even set the function’s displayName property to include the component you’re wrapping:
function logProps(Component) {
  class LogProps extends React.Component {
    // ...
  }
  function forwardRef(props, ref) {
    return <LogProps {...props} forwardedRef={ref} />;
  }
  // Give this component a more helpful display name in DevTools.
  // e.g. "ForwardRef(logProps(MyComponent))"
  const name = Component.displayName || Component.name;
  forwardRef.displayName = `logProps(${name})`;
  return React.forwardRef(forwardRef);
}

fragments
-----------------------------------------------------------
Fragments
A common pattern in React is for a component to return multiple elements. Fragments let you group a list of children without adding extra nodes to the DOM. render() {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      <ChildA />
      <ChildB />
      <ChildC />
    </React.Fragment>
  );
} There is also a new short syntax for declaring them. Motivation  A common pattern is for a component to return a list of children. Take this example React snippet: class Table extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <table>
        <tr>
          <Columns />
        </tr>
      </table>
    );
  }
} <Columns /> would need to return multiple <td> elements in order for the rendered HTML to be valid. If a parent div was used inside the render() of <Columns />, then the resulting HTML will be invalid. class Columns extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <td>Hello</td>
        <td>World</td>
      </div>
    );
  }
} results in a <Table /> output of: <table>
  <tr>
    <div>
      <td>Hello</td>
      <td>World</td>
    </div>
  </tr>
</table> Fragments solve this problem. Usage  class Columns extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <React.Fragment>
        <td>Hello</td>
        <td>World</td>
      </React.Fragment>
    );
  }
} which results in a correct <Table /> output of: <table>
  <tr>
    <td>Hello</td>
    <td>World</td>
  </tr>
</table> Short Syntax  There is a new, shorter syntax you can use for declaring fragments. It looks like empty tags: class Columns extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <td>Hello</td>
        <td>World</td>
      </>
    );
  }
} You can use <></> the same way you’d use any other element except that it doesn’t support keys or attributes. Keyed Fragments  Fragments declared with the explicit <React.Fragment> syntax may have keys. A use case for this is mapping a collection to an array of fragments — for example, to create a description list: function Glossary(props) {
  return (
    <dl>
      {props.items.map(item => (
        // Without the `key`, React will fire a key warning
        <React.Fragment key={item.id}>
          <dt>{item.term}</dt>
          <dd>{item.description}</dd>
        </React.Fragment>
      ))}
    </dl>
  );
} key is the only attribute that can be passed to Fragment. In the future, we may add support for additional attributes, such as event handlers. Live Demo  You can try out the new JSX fragment syntax with this CodePen.

Getting Started
This page is an overview of the React documentation and related resources. React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces. Learn what React is all about on our homepage or in the tutorial.  Try React Learn React Staying Informed Versioned Documentation Something Missing?  Try React  React has been designed from the start for gradual adoption, and you can use as little or as much React as you need. Whether you want to get a taste of React, add some interactivity to a simple HTML page, or start a complex React-powered app, the links in this section will help you get started. Online Playgrounds  If you’re interested in playing around with React, you can use an online code playground. Try a Hello World template on CodePen, CodeSandbox, or Stackblitz. If you prefer to use your own text editor, you can also download this HTML file, edit it, and open it from the local filesystem in your browser. It does a slow runtime code transformation, so we’d only recommend using this for simple demos. Add React to a Website  You can add React to an HTML page in one minute. You can then either gradually expand its presence, or keep it contained to a few dynamic widgets. Create a New React App  When starting a React project, a simple HTML page with script tags might still be the best option. It only takes a minute to set up! As your application grows, you might want to consider a more integrated setup. There are several JavaScript toolchains we recommend for larger applications. Each of them can work with little to no configuration and lets you take full advantage of the rich React ecosystem. Learn how. Learn React  People come to React from different backgrounds and with different learning styles. Whether you prefer a more theoretical or a practical approach, we hope you’ll find this section helpful.  If you prefer to learn by doing, start with our practical tutorial. If you prefer to learn concepts step by step, start with our guide to main concepts.  Like any unfamiliar technology, React does have a learning curve. With practice and some patience, you will get the hang of it. First Examples  The React homepage contains a few small React examples with a live editor. Even if you don’t know anything about React yet, try changing their code and see how it affects the result. React for Beginners  If you feel that the React documentation goes at a faster pace than you’re comfortable with, check out this overview of React by Tania Rascia. It introduces the most important React concepts in a detailed, beginner-friendly way. Once you’re done, give the documentation another try! React for Designers  If you’re coming from a design background, these resources are a great place to get started. JavaScript Resources  The React documentation assumes some familiarity with programming in the JavaScript language. You don’t have to be an expert, but it’s harder to learn both React and JavaScript at the same time. We recommend going through this JavaScript overview to check your knowledge level. It will take you between 30 minutes and an hour but you will feel more confident learning React.  Tip Whenever you get confused by something in JavaScript, MDN and javascript.info are great websites to check. There are also community support forums where you can ask for help.  Practical Tutorial  If you prefer to learn by doing, check out our practical tutorial. In this tutorial, we build a tic-tac-toe game in React. You might be tempted to skip it because you’re not into building games — but give it a chance. The techniques you’ll learn in the tutorial are fundamental to building any React apps, and mastering it will give you a much deeper understanding. Step-by-Step Guide  If you prefer to learn concepts step by step, our guide to main concepts is the best place to start. Every next chapter in it builds on the knowledge introduced in the previous chapters so you won’t miss anything as you go along. Thinking in React  Many React users credit reading Thinking in React as the moment React finally “clicked” for them. It’s probably the oldest React walkthrough but it’s still just as relevant. Recommended Courses  Sometimes people find third-party books and video courses more helpful than the official documentation. We maintain a list of commonly recommended resources, some of which are free. Advanced Concepts  Once you’re comfortable with the main concepts and played with React a little bit, you might be interested in more advanced topics. This section will introduce you to the powerful, but less commonly used React features like context and refs. API Reference  This documentation section is useful when you want to learn more details about a particular React API. For example, React.Component API reference can provide you with details on how setState() works, and what different lifecycle methods are useful for. Glossary and FAQ  The glossary contains an overview of the most common terms you’ll see in the React documentation. There is also a FAQ section dedicated to short questions and answers about common topics, including making AJAX requests, component state, and file structure. Staying Informed  The React blog is the official source for the updates from the React team. Anything important, including release notes or deprecation notices, will be posted there first. You can also follow the @reactjs account on Twitter, but you won’t miss anything essential if you only read the blog. Not every React release deserves its own blog post, but you can find a detailed changelog for every release in the CHANGELOG.md file in the React repository, as well as on the Releases page. Versioned Documentation  This documentation always reflects the latest stable version of React. Since React 16, you can find older versions of the documentation on a separate page. Note that documentation for past versions is snapshotted at the time of the release, and isn’t being continuously updated. Something Missing?  If something is missing in the documentation or if you found some part confusing, please file an issue for the documentation repository with your suggestions for improvement, or tweet at the @reactjs account. We love hearing from you!

glossary
-----------------------------------------------------------
Glossary of React Terms
Single-page Application  A single-page application is an application that loads a single HTML page and all the necessary assets (such as JavaScript and CSS) required for the application to run. Any interactions with the page or subsequent pages do not require a round trip to the server which means the page is not reloaded. Though you may build a single-page application in React, it is not a requirement. React can also be used for enhancing small parts of existing websites with additional interactivity. Code written in React can coexist peacefully with markup rendered on the server by something like PHP, or with other client-side libraries. In fact, this is exactly how React is being used at Facebook. ES6, ES2015, ES2016, etc  These acronyms all refer to the most recent versions of the ECMAScript Language Specification standard, which the JavaScript language is an implementation of. The ES6 version (also known as ES2015) includes many additions to the previous versions such as: arrow functions, classes, template literals, let and const statements. You can learn more about specific versions here. Compilers  A JavaScript compiler takes JavaScript code, transforms it and returns JavaScript code in a different format. The most common use case is to take ES6 syntax and transform it into syntax that older browsers are capable of interpreting. Babel is the compiler most commonly used with React. Bundlers  Bundlers take JavaScript and CSS code written as separate modules (often hundreds of them), and combine them together into a few files better optimized for the browsers. Some bundlers commonly used in React applications include Webpack and Browserify. Package Managers  Package managers are tools that allow you to manage dependencies in your project. npm and Yarn are two package managers commonly used in React applications. Both of them are clients for the same npm package registry. CDN  CDN stands for Content Delivery Network. CDNs deliver cached, static content from a network of servers across the globe.  JSX  JSX is a syntax extension to JavaScript. It is similar to a template language, but it has full power of JavaScript. JSX gets compiled to React.createElement() calls which return plain JavaScript objects called “React elements”. To get a basic introduction to JSX see the docs here and find a more in-depth tutorial on JSX here. React DOM uses camelCase property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names. For example, tabindex becomes tabIndex in JSX. The attribute class is also written as className since class is a reserved word in JavaScript: const name = 'Clementine';
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1 className="hello">My name is {name}!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
); 
Elements  React elements are the building blocks of React applications. One might confuse elements with a more widely known concept of “components”. An element describes what you want to see on the screen. React elements are immutable. const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>; Typically, elements are not used directly, but get returned from components. 
Components  React components are small, reusable pieces of code that return a React element to be rendered to the page. The simplest version of React component is a plain JavaScript function that returns a React element: function Welcome(props) {
  return <h1>Hello, {props.name}</h1>;
} Components can also be ES6 classes: class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
} Components can be broken down into distinct pieces of functionality and used within other components. Components can return other components, arrays, strings and numbers. A good rule of thumb is that if a part of your UI is used several times (Button, Panel, Avatar), or is complex enough on its own (App, FeedStory, Comment), it is a good candidate to be a reusable component. Component names should also always start with a capital letter (<Wrapper/> not <wrapper/>). See this documentation for more information on rendering components.  
props  props are inputs to a React component. They are data passed down from a parent component to a child component. Remember that props are readonly. They should not be modified in any way: // Wrong!
props.number = 42; If you need to modify some value in response to user input or a network response, use state instead. 
props.children  props.children is available on every component. It contains the content between the opening and closing tags of a component. For example: <Welcome>Hello world!</Welcome> The string Hello world! is available in props.children in the Welcome component: function Welcome(props) {
  return <p>{props.children}</p>;
} For components defined as classes, use this.props.children: class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <p>{this.props.children}</p>;
  }
} 
state  A component needs state when some data associated with it changes over time. For example, a Checkbox component might need isChecked in its state, and a NewsFeed component might want to keep track of fetchedPosts in its state. The most important difference between state and props is that props are passed from a parent component, but state is managed by the component itself. A component cannot change its props, but it can change its state. For each particular piece of changing data, there should be just one component that “owns” it in its state. Don’t try to synchronize states of two different components. Instead, lift it up to their closest shared ancestor, and pass it down as props to both of them. 
Lifecycle Methods  Lifecycle methods are custom functionality that gets executed during the different phases of a component. There are methods available when the component gets created and inserted into the DOM (mounting), when the component updates, and when the component gets unmounted or removed from the DOM. 
Controlled vs. Uncontrolled Components
 React has two different approaches to dealing with form inputs.  An input form element whose value is controlled by React is called a controlled component. When a user enters data into a controlled component a change event handler is triggered and your code decides whether the input is valid (by re-rendering with the updated value). If you do not re-render then the form element will remain unchanged. An uncontrolled component works like form elements do outside of React. When a user inputs data into a form field (an input box, dropdown, etc) the updated information is reflected without React needing to do anything. However, this also means that you can’t force the field to have a certain value. In most cases you should use controlled components. 
Keys  A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating arrays of elements. Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside an array to give the elements a stable identity. Keys only need to be unique among sibling elements in the same array. They don’t need to be unique across the whole application or even a single component. Don’t pass something like Math.random() to keys. It is important that keys have a “stable identity” across re-renders so that React can determine when items are added, removed, or re-ordered. Ideally, keys should correspond to unique and stable identifiers coming from your data, such as post.id. 
Refs  React supports a special attribute that you can attach to any component. The ref attribute can be an object created by React.createRef() function or a callback function, or a string (in legacy API). When the ref attribute is a callback function, the function receives the underlying DOM element or class instance (depending on the type of element) as its argument. This allows you to have direct access to the DOM element or component instance. Use refs sparingly. If you find yourself often using refs to “make things happen” in your app, consider getting more familiar with top-down data flow. 
Events  Handling events with React elements has some syntactic differences:  React event handlers are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase. With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.  
Reconciliation  When a component’s props or state change, React decides whether an actual DOM update is necessary by comparing the newly returned element with the previously rendered one. When they are not equal, React will update the DOM. This process is called “reconciliation”.

handling-events
-----------------------------------------------------------
Handling Events
Handling events with React elements is very similar to handling events on DOM elements. There are some syntax differences:  React events are named using camelCase, rather than lowercase. With JSX you pass a function as the event handler, rather than a string.  For example, the HTML: <button onclick="activateLasers()">
  Activate Lasers
</button> is slightly different in React: <button onClick={activateLasers}>
  Activate Lasers
</button> Another difference is that you cannot return false to prevent default behavior in React. You must call preventDefault explicitly. For example, with plain HTML, to prevent the default form behavior of submitting, you can write: <form onsubmit="console.log('You clicked submit.'); return false">
  <button type="submit">Submit</button>
</form> In React, this could instead be: function Form() {
  function handleSubmit(e) {
    e.preventDefault();
    console.log('You clicked submit.');
  }
  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <button type="submit">Submit</button>
    </form>
  );
} Here, e is a synthetic event. React defines these synthetic events according to the W3C spec, so you don’t need to worry about cross-browser compatibility. React events do not work exactly the same as native events. See the SyntheticEvent reference guide to learn more. When using React, you generally don’t need to call addEventListener to add listeners to a DOM element after it is created. Instead, just provide a listener when the element is initially rendered. When you define a component using an ES6 class, a common pattern is for an event handler to be a method on the class. For example, this Toggle component renders a button that lets the user toggle between “ON” and “OFF” states: class Toggle extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {isToggleOn: true};
    // This binding is necessary to make `this` work in the callback
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }
  handleClick() {
    this.setState(prevState => ({
      isToggleOn: !prevState.isToggleOn
    }));
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        {this.state.isToggleOn ? 'ON' : 'OFF'}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(
  <Toggle />,
  document.getElementById('root')
); Try it on CodePen You have to be careful about the meaning of this in JSX callbacks. In JavaScript, class methods are not bound by default. If you forget to bind this.handleClick and pass it to onClick, this will be undefined when the function is actually called. This is not React-specific behavior; it is a part of how functions work in JavaScript. Generally, if you refer to a method without () after it, such as onClick={this.handleClick}, you should bind that method. If calling bind annoys you, there are two ways you can get around this. If you are using the experimental public class fields syntax, you can use class fields to correctly bind callbacks: class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick.
  // Warning: this is *experimental* syntax.
  handleClick = () => {
    console.log('this is:', this);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        Click me
      </button>
    );
  }
} This syntax is enabled by default in Create React App. If you aren’t using class fields syntax, you can use an arrow function in the callback: class LoggingButton extends React.Component {
  handleClick() {
    console.log('this is:', this);
  }
  render() {
    // This syntax ensures `this` is bound within handleClick
    return (
      <button onClick={() => this.handleClick()}>
        Click me
      </button>
    );
  }
} The problem with this syntax is that a different callback is created each time the LoggingButton renders. In most cases, this is fine. However, if this callback is passed as a prop to lower components, those components might do an extra re-rendering. We generally recommend binding in the constructor or using the class fields syntax, to avoid this sort of performance problem. Passing Arguments to Event Handlers  Inside a loop, it is common to want to pass an extra parameter to an event handler. For example, if id is the row ID, either of the following would work: <button onClick={(e) => this.deleteRow(id, e)}>Delete Row</button>
<button onClick={this.deleteRow.bind(this, id)}>Delete Row</button> The above two lines are equivalent, and use arrow functions and Function.prototype.bind respectively. In both cases, the e argument representing the React event will be passed as a second argument after the ID. With an arrow function, we have to pass it explicitly, but with bind any further arguments are automatically forwarded.

higher-order-components
-----------------------------------------------------------
Higher-Order Components
A higher-order component (HOC) is an advanced technique in React for reusing component logic. HOCs are not part of the React API, per se. They are a pattern that emerges from React’s compositional nature. Concretely, a higher-order component is a function that takes a component and returns a new component. const EnhancedComponent = higherOrderComponent(WrappedComponent); Whereas a component transforms props into UI, a higher-order component transforms a component into another component. HOCs are common in third-party React libraries, such as Redux’s connect and Relay’s createFragmentContainer. In this document, we’ll discuss why higher-order components are useful, and how to write your own. Use HOCs For Cross-Cutting Concerns   Note We previously recommended mixins as a way to handle cross-cutting concerns. We’ve since realized that mixins create more trouble than they are worth. Read more about why we’ve moved away from mixins and how you can transition your existing components.  Components are the primary unit of code reuse in React. However, you’ll find that some patterns aren’t a straightforward fit for traditional components. For example, say you have a CommentList component that subscribes to an external data source to render a list of comments: class CommentList extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.state = {
      // "DataSource" is some global data source
      comments: DataSource.getComments()
    };
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    // Subscribe to changes
    DataSource.addChangeListener(this.handleChange);
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    // Clean up listener
    DataSource.removeChangeListener(this.handleChange);
  }
  handleChange() {
    // Update component state whenever the data source changes
    this.setState({
      comments: DataSource.getComments()
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.state.comments.map((comment) => (
          <Comment comment={comment} key={comment.id} />
        ))}
      </div>
    );
  }
} Later, you write a component for subscribing to a single blog post, which follows a similar pattern: class BlogPost extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.state = {
      blogPost: DataSource.getBlogPost(props.id)
    };
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    DataSource.addChangeListener(this.handleChange);
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    DataSource.removeChangeListener(this.handleChange);
  }
  handleChange() {
    this.setState({
      blogPost: DataSource.getBlogPost(this.props.id)
    });
  }
  render() {
    return <TextBlock text={this.state.blogPost} />;
  }
} CommentList and BlogPost aren’t identical — they call different methods on DataSource, and they render different output. But much of their implementation is the same:  On mount, add a change listener to DataSource. Inside the listener, call setState whenever the data source changes. On unmount, remove the change listener.  You can imagine that in a large app, this same pattern of subscribing to DataSource and calling setState will occur over and over again. We want an abstraction that allows us to define this logic in a single place and share it across many components. This is where higher-order components excel. We can write a function that creates components, like CommentList and BlogPost, that subscribe to DataSource. The function will accept as one of its arguments a child component that receives the subscribed data as a prop. Let’s call the function withSubscription: const CommentListWithSubscription = withSubscription(
  CommentList,
  (DataSource) => DataSource.getComments()
);
const BlogPostWithSubscription = withSubscription(
  BlogPost,
  (DataSource, props) => DataSource.getBlogPost(props.id)
); The first parameter is the wrapped component. The second parameter retrieves the data we’re interested in, given a DataSource and the current props. When CommentListWithSubscription and BlogPostWithSubscription are rendered, CommentList and BlogPost will be passed a data prop with the most current data retrieved from DataSource: // This function takes a component...
function withSubscription(WrappedComponent, selectData) {
  // ...and returns another component...
  return class extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
      this.state = {
        data: selectData(DataSource, props)
      };
    }
    componentDidMount() {
      // ... that takes care of the subscription...
      DataSource.addChangeListener(this.handleChange);
    }
    componentWillUnmount() {
      DataSource.removeChangeListener(this.handleChange);
    }
    handleChange() {
      this.setState({
        data: selectData(DataSource, this.props)
      });
    }
    render() {
      // ... and renders the wrapped component with the fresh data!
      // Notice that we pass through any additional props
      return <WrappedComponent data={this.state.data} {...this.props} />;
    }
  };
} Note that a HOC doesn’t modify the input component, nor does it use inheritance to copy its behavior. Rather, a HOC composes the original component by wrapping it in a container component. A HOC is a pure function with zero side-effects. And that’s it! The wrapped component receives all the props of the container, along with a new prop, data, which it uses to render its output. The HOC isn’t concerned with how or why the data is used, and the wrapped component isn’t concerned with where the data came from. Because withSubscription is a normal function, you can add as many or as few arguments as you like. For example, you may want to make the name of the data prop configurable, to further isolate the HOC from the wrapped component. Or you could accept an argument that configures shouldComponentUpdate, or one that configures the data source. These are all possible because the HOC has full control over how the component is defined. Like components, the contract between withSubscription and the wrapped component is entirely props-based. This makes it easy to swap one HOC for a different one, as long as they provide the same props to the wrapped component. This may be useful if you change data-fetching libraries, for example. Don’t Mutate the Original Component. Use Composition.  Resist the temptation to modify a component’s prototype (or otherwise mutate it) inside a HOC. function logProps(InputComponent) {
  InputComponent.prototype.componentDidUpdate = function(prevProps) {
    console.log('Current props: ', this.props);
    console.log('Previous props: ', prevProps);
  };
  // The fact that we're returning the original input is a hint that it has
  // been mutated.
  return InputComponent;
}
// EnhancedComponent will log whenever props are received
const EnhancedComponent = logProps(InputComponent); There are a few problems with this. One is that the input component cannot be reused separately from the enhanced component. More crucially, if you apply another HOC to EnhancedComponent that also mutates componentDidUpdate, the first HOC’s functionality will be overridden! This HOC also won’t work with function components, which do not have lifecycle methods. Mutating HOCs are a leaky abstraction—the consumer must know how they are implemented in order to avoid conflicts with other HOCs. Instead of mutation, HOCs should use composition, by wrapping the input component in a container component: function logProps(WrappedComponent) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
      console.log('Current props: ', this.props);
      console.log('Previous props: ', prevProps);
    }
    render() {
      // Wraps the input component in a container, without mutating it. Good!
      return <WrappedComponent {...this.props} />;
    }
  }
} This HOC has the same functionality as the mutating version while avoiding the potential for clashes. It works equally well with class and function components. And because it’s a pure function, it’s composable with other HOCs, or even with itself. You may have noticed similarities between HOCs and a pattern called container components. Container components are part of a strategy of separating responsibility between high-level and low-level concerns. Containers manage things like subscriptions and state, and pass props to components that handle things like rendering UI. HOCs use containers as part of their implementation. You can think of HOCs as parameterized container component definitions. Convention: Pass Unrelated Props Through to the Wrapped Component  HOCs add features to a component. They shouldn’t drastically alter its contract. It’s expected that the component returned from a HOC has a similar interface to the wrapped component. HOCs should pass through props that are unrelated to its specific concern. Most HOCs contain a render method that looks something like this: render() {
  // Filter out extra props that are specific to this HOC and shouldn't be
  // passed through
  const { extraProp, ...passThroughProps } = this.props;
  // Inject props into the wrapped component. These are usually state values or
  // instance methods.
  const injectedProp = someStateOrInstanceMethod;
  // Pass props to wrapped component
  return (
    <WrappedComponent
      injectedProp={injectedProp}
      {...passThroughProps}
    />
  );
} This convention helps ensure that HOCs are as flexible and reusable as possible. Convention: Maximizing Composability  Not all HOCs look the same. Sometimes they accept only a single argument, the wrapped component: const NavbarWithRouter = withRouter(Navbar); Usually, HOCs accept additional arguments. In this example from Relay, a config object is used to specify a component’s data dependencies: const CommentWithRelay = Relay.createContainer(Comment, config); The most common signature for HOCs looks like this: // React Redux's `connect`
const ConnectedComment = connect(commentSelector, commentActions)(CommentList); What?! If you break it apart, it’s easier to see what’s going on. // connect is a function that returns another function
const enhance = connect(commentListSelector, commentListActions);
// The returned function is a HOC, which returns a component that is connected
// to the Redux store
const ConnectedComment = enhance(CommentList); In other words, connect is a higher-order function that returns a higher-order component! This form may seem confusing or unnecessary, but it has a useful property. Single-argument HOCs like the one returned by the connect function have the signature Component => Component. Functions whose output type is the same as its input type are really easy to compose together. // Instead of doing this...
const EnhancedComponent = withRouter(connect(commentSelector)(WrappedComponent))
// ... you can use a function composition utility
// compose(f, g, h) is the same as (...args) => f(g(h(...args)))
const enhance = compose(
  // These are both single-argument HOCs
  withRouter,
  connect(commentSelector)
)
const EnhancedComponent = enhance(WrappedComponent) (This same property also allows connect and other enhancer-style HOCs to be used as decorators, an experimental JavaScript proposal.) The compose utility function is provided by many third-party libraries including lodash (as lodash.flowRight), Redux, and Ramda. Convention: Wrap the Display Name for Easy Debugging  The container components created by HOCs show up in the React Developer Tools like any other component. To ease debugging, choose a display name that communicates that it’s the result of a HOC. The most common technique is to wrap the display name of the wrapped component. So if your higher-order component is named withSubscription, and the wrapped component’s display name is CommentList, use the display name WithSubscription(CommentList): function withSubscription(WrappedComponent) {
  class WithSubscription extends React.Component {/* ... */}
  WithSubscription.displayName = `WithSubscription(${getDisplayName(WrappedComponent)})`;
  return WithSubscription;
}
function getDisplayName(WrappedComponent) {
  return WrappedComponent.displayName || WrappedComponent.name || 'Component';
} Caveats  Higher-order components come with a few caveats that aren’t immediately obvious if you’re new to React. Don’t Use HOCs Inside the render Method  React’s diffing algorithm (called Reconciliation) uses component identity to determine whether it should update the existing subtree or throw it away and mount a new one. If the component returned from render is identical (===) to the component from the previous render, React recursively updates the subtree by diffing it with the new one. If they’re not equal, the previous subtree is unmounted completely. Normally, you shouldn’t need to think about this. But it matters for HOCs because it means you can’t apply a HOC to a component within the render method of a component: render() {
  // A new version of EnhancedComponent is created on every render
  // EnhancedComponent1 !== EnhancedComponent2
  const EnhancedComponent = enhance(MyComponent);
  // That causes the entire subtree to unmount/remount each time!
  return <EnhancedComponent />;
} The problem here isn’t just about performance — remounting a component causes the state of that component and all of its children to be lost. Instead, apply HOCs outside the component definition so that the resulting component is created only once. Then, its identity will be consistent across renders. This is usually what you want, anyway. In those rare cases where you need to apply a HOC dynamically, you can also do it inside a component’s lifecycle methods or its constructor. Static Methods Must Be Copied Over  Sometimes it’s useful to define a static method on a React component. For example, Relay containers expose a static method getFragment to facilitate the composition of GraphQL fragments. When you apply a HOC to a component, though, the original component is wrapped with a container component. That means the new component does not have any of the static methods of the original component. // Define a static method
WrappedComponent.staticMethod = function() {/*...*/}
// Now apply a HOC
const EnhancedComponent = enhance(WrappedComponent);
// The enhanced component has no static method
typeof EnhancedComponent.staticMethod === 'undefined' // true To solve this, you could copy the methods onto the container before returning it: function enhance(WrappedComponent) {
  class Enhance extends React.Component {/*...*/}
  // Must know exactly which method(s) to copy :(
  Enhance.staticMethod = WrappedComponent.staticMethod;
  return Enhance;
} However, this requires you to know exactly which methods need to be copied. You can use hoist-non-react-statics to automatically copy all non-React static methods: import hoistNonReactStatic from 'hoist-non-react-statics';
function enhance(WrappedComponent) {
  class Enhance extends React.Component {/*...*/}
  hoistNonReactStatic(Enhance, WrappedComponent);
  return Enhance;
} Another possible solution is to export the static method separately from the component itself. // Instead of...
MyComponent.someFunction = someFunction;
export default MyComponent;
// ...export the method separately...
export { someFunction };
// ...and in the consuming module, import both
import MyComponent, { someFunction } from './MyComponent.js'; Refs Aren’t Passed Through  While the convention for higher-order components is to pass through all props to the wrapped component, this does not work for refs. That’s because ref is not really a prop — like key, it’s handled specially by React. If you add a ref to an element whose component is the result of a HOC, the ref refers to an instance of the outermost container component, not the wrapped component. The solution for this problem is to use the React.forwardRef API (introduced with React 16.3). Learn more about it in the forwarding refs section.

hooks-custom
-----------------------------------------------------------
Building Your Own Hooks
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Building your own Hooks lets you extract component logic into reusable functions. When we were learning about using the Effect Hook, we saw this component from a chat application that displays a message indicating whether a friend is online or offline: import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
function FriendStatus(props) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleStatusChange(status) {
      setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
    }
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });
  if (isOnline === null) {
    return 'Loading...';
  }
  return isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';
} Now let’s say that our chat application also has a contact list, and we want to render names of online users with a green color. We could copy and paste similar logic above into our FriendListItem component but it wouldn’t be ideal: import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
function FriendListItem(props) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleStatusChange(status) {
      setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
    }
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });
  return (
    <li style={{ color: isOnline ? 'green' : 'black' }}>
      {props.friend.name}
    </li>
  );
} Instead, we’d like to share this logic between FriendStatus and FriendListItem. Traditionally in React, we’ve had two popular ways to share stateful logic between components: render props and higher-order components. We will now look at how Hooks solve many of the same problems without forcing you to add more components to the tree. Extracting a Custom Hook  When we want to share logic between two JavaScript functions, we extract it to a third function. Both components and Hooks are functions, so this works for them too! A custom Hook is a JavaScript function whose name starts with ”use” and that may call other Hooks. For example, useFriendStatus below is our first custom Hook: import { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
function useFriendStatus(friendID) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleStatusChange(status) {
      setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
    }
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });
  return isOnline;
} There’s nothing new inside of it — the logic is copied from the components above. Just like in a component, make sure to only call other Hooks unconditionally at the top level of your custom Hook. Unlike a React component, a custom Hook doesn’t need to have a specific signature. We can decide what it takes as arguments, and what, if anything, it should return. In other words, it’s just like a normal function. Its name should always start with use so that you can tell at a glance that the rules of Hooks apply to it. The purpose of our useFriendStatus Hook is to subscribe us to a friend’s status. This is why it takes friendID as an argument, and returns whether this friend is online: function useFriendStatus(friendID) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);
  // ...
  return isOnline;
} Now let’s see how we can use our custom Hook. Using a Custom Hook  In the beginning, our stated goal was to remove the duplicated logic from the FriendStatus and FriendListItem components. Both of them want to know whether a friend is online. Now that we’ve extracted this logic to a useFriendStatus hook, we can just use it: function FriendStatus(props) {
  const isOnline = useFriendStatus(props.friend.id);
  if (isOnline === null) {
    return 'Loading...';
  }
  return isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';
} function FriendListItem(props) {
  const isOnline = useFriendStatus(props.friend.id);
  return (
    <li style={{ color: isOnline ? 'green' : 'black' }}>
      {props.friend.name}
    </li>
  );
} Is this code equivalent to the original examples? Yes, it works in exactly the same way. If you look closely, you’ll notice we didn’t make any changes to the behavior. All we did was to extract some common code between two functions into a separate function. Custom Hooks are a convention that naturally follows from the design of Hooks, rather than a React feature. Do I have to name my custom Hooks starting with “use”? Please do. This convention is very important. Without it, we wouldn’t be able to automatically check for violations of rules of Hooks because we couldn’t tell if a certain function contains calls to Hooks inside of it. Do two components using the same Hook share state? No. Custom Hooks are a mechanism to reuse stateful logic (such as setting up a subscription and remembering the current value), but every time you use a custom Hook, all state and effects inside of it are fully isolated. How does a custom Hook get isolated state? Each call to a Hook gets isolated state. Because we call useFriendStatus directly, from React’s point of view our component just calls useState and useEffect. And as we learned earlier, we can call useState and useEffect many times in one component, and they will be completely independent. Tip: Pass Information Between Hooks  Since Hooks are functions, we can pass information between them. To illustrate this, we’ll use another component from our hypothetical chat example. This is a chat message recipient picker that displays whether the currently selected friend is online: const friendList = [
  { id: 1, name: 'Phoebe' },
  { id: 2, name: 'Rachel' },
  { id: 3, name: 'Ross' },
];
function ChatRecipientPicker() {
  const [recipientID, setRecipientID] = useState(1);
  const isRecipientOnline = useFriendStatus(recipientID);
  return (
    <>
      <Circle color={isRecipientOnline ? 'green' : 'red'} />
      <select
        value={recipientID}
        onChange={e => setRecipientID(Number(e.target.value))}
      >
        {friendList.map(friend => (
          <option key={friend.id} value={friend.id}>
            {friend.name}
          </option>
        ))}
      </select>
    </>
  );
} We keep the currently chosen friend ID in the recipientID state variable, and update it if the user chooses a different friend in the <select> picker. Because the useState Hook call gives us the latest value of the recipientID state variable, we can pass it to our custom useFriendStatus Hook as an argument:   const [recipientID, setRecipientID] = useState(1);
  const isRecipientOnline = useFriendStatus(recipientID); This lets us know whether the currently selected friend is online. If we pick a different friend and update the recipientID state variable, our useFriendStatus Hook will unsubscribe from the previously selected friend, and subscribe to the status of the newly selected one. 
useYourImagination()  Custom Hooks offer the flexibility of sharing logic that wasn’t possible in React components before. You can write custom Hooks that cover a wide range of use cases like form handling, animation, declarative subscriptions, timers, and probably many more we haven’t considered. What’s more, you can build Hooks that are just as easy to use as React’s built-in features. Try to resist adding abstraction too early. Now that function components can do more, it’s likely that the average function component in your codebase will become longer. This is normal — don’t feel like you have to immediately split it into Hooks. But we also encourage you to start spotting cases where a custom Hook could hide complex logic behind a simple interface, or help untangle a messy component. For example, maybe you have a complex component that contains a lot of local state that is managed in an ad-hoc way. useState doesn’t make centralizing the update logic any easier so you might prefer to write it as a Redux reducer: function todosReducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'add':
      return [...state, {
        text: action.text,
        completed: false
      }];
    // ... other actions ...
    default:
      return state;
  }
} Reducers are very convenient to test in isolation, and scale to express complex update logic. You can further break them apart into smaller reducers if necessary. However, you might also enjoy the benefits of using React local state, or might not want to install another library. So what if we could write a useReducer Hook that lets us manage the local state of our component with a reducer? A simplified version of it might look like this: function useReducer(reducer, initialState) {
  const [state, setState] = useState(initialState);
  function dispatch(action) {
    const nextState = reducer(state, action);
    setState(nextState);
  }
  return [state, dispatch];
} Now we could use it in our component, and let the reducer drive its state management: function Todos() {
  const [todos, dispatch] = useReducer(todosReducer, []);
  function handleAddClick(text) {
    dispatch({ type: 'add', text });
  }
  // ...
} The need to manage local state with a reducer in a complex component is common enough that we’ve built the useReducer Hook right into React. You’ll find it together with other built-in Hooks in the Hooks API reference.

hooks-effect
-----------------------------------------------------------
Using the Effect Hook
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. The Effect Hook lets you perform side effects in function components: import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
} This snippet is based on the counter example from the previous page, but we added a new feature to it: we set the document title to a custom message including the number of clicks. Data fetching, setting up a subscription, and manually changing the DOM in React components are all examples of side effects. Whether or not you’re used to calling these operations “side effects” (or just “effects”), you’ve likely performed them in your components before.  Tip If you’re familiar with React class lifecycle methods, you can think of useEffect Hook as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount combined.  There are two common kinds of side effects in React components: those that don’t require cleanup, and those that do. Let’s look at this distinction in more detail. Effects Without Cleanup  Sometimes, we want to run some additional code after React has updated the DOM. Network requests, manual DOM mutations, and logging are common examples of effects that don’t require a cleanup. We say that because we can run them and immediately forget about them. Let’s compare how classes and Hooks let us express such side effects. Example Using Classes  In React class components, the render method itself shouldn’t cause side effects. It would be too early — we typically want to perform our effects after React has updated the DOM. This is why in React classes, we put side effects into componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. Coming back to our example, here is a React counter class component that updates the document title right after React makes changes to the DOM: class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
} Note how we have to duplicate the code between these two lifecycle methods in class. This is because in many cases we want to perform the same side effect regardless of whether the component just mounted, or if it has been updated. Conceptually, we want it to happen after every render — but React class components don’t have a method like this. We could extract a separate method but we would still have to call it in two places. Now let’s see how we can do the same with the useEffect Hook. Example Using Hooks  We’ve already seen this example at the top of this page, but let’s take a closer look at it: import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
} What does useEffect do? By using this Hook, you tell React that your component needs to do something after render. React will remember the function you passed (we’ll refer to it as our “effect”), and call it later after performing the DOM updates. In this effect, we set the document title, but we could also perform data fetching or call some other imperative API. Why is useEffect called inside a component? Placing useEffect inside the component lets us access the count state variable (or any props) right from the effect. We don’t need a special API to read it — it’s already in the function scope. Hooks embrace JavaScript closures and avoid introducing React-specific APIs where JavaScript already provides a solution. Does useEffect run after every render? Yes! By default, it runs both after the first render and after every update. (We will later talk about how to customize this.) Instead of thinking in terms of “mounting” and “updating”, you might find it easier to think that effects happen “after render”. React guarantees the DOM has been updated by the time it runs the effects. Detailed Explanation  Now that we know more about effects, these lines should make sense: function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });
} We declare the count state variable, and then we tell React we need to use an effect. We pass a function to the useEffect Hook. This function we pass is our effect. Inside our effect, we set the document title using the document.title browser API. We can read the latest count inside the effect because it’s in the scope of our function. When React renders our component, it will remember the effect we used, and then run our effect after updating the DOM. This happens for every render, including the first one. Experienced JavaScript developers might notice that the function passed to useEffect is going to be different on every render. This is intentional. In fact, this is what lets us read the count value from inside the effect without worrying about it getting stale. Every time we re-render, we schedule a different effect, replacing the previous one. In a way, this makes the effects behave more like a part of the render result — each effect “belongs” to a particular render. We will see more clearly why this is useful later on this page.  Tip Unlike componentDidMount or componentDidUpdate, effects scheduled with useEffect don’t block the browser from updating the screen. This makes your app feel more responsive. The majority of effects don’t need to happen synchronously. In the uncommon cases where they do (such as measuring the layout), there is a separate useLayoutEffect Hook with an API identical to useEffect.  Effects with Cleanup  Earlier, we looked at how to express side effects that don’t require any cleanup. However, some effects do. For example, we might want to set up a subscription to some external data source. In that case, it is important to clean up so that we don’t introduce a memory leak! Let’s compare how we can do it with classes and with Hooks. Example Using Classes  In a React class, you would typically set up a subscription in componentDidMount, and clean it up in componentWillUnmount. For example, let’s say we have a ChatAPI module that lets us subscribe to a friend’s online status. Here’s how we might subscribe and display that status using a class: class FriendStatus extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { isOnline: null };
    this.handleStatusChange = this.handleStatusChange.bind(this);
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(
      this.props.friend.id,
      this.handleStatusChange
    );
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(
      this.props.friend.id,
      this.handleStatusChange
    );
  }
  handleStatusChange(status) {
    this.setState({
      isOnline: status.isOnline
    });
  }
  render() {
    if (this.state.isOnline === null) {
      return 'Loading...';
    }
    return this.state.isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';
  }
} Notice how componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount need to mirror each other. Lifecycle methods force us to split this logic even though conceptually code in both of them is related to the same effect.  Note Eagle-eyed readers may notice that this example also needs a componentDidUpdate method to be fully correct. We’ll ignore this for now but will come back to it in a later section of this page.  Example Using Hooks  Let’s see how we could write this component with Hooks. You might be thinking that we’d need a separate effect to perform the cleanup. But code for adding and removing a subscription is so tightly related that useEffect is designed to keep it together. If your effect returns a function, React will run it when it is time to clean up: import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
function FriendStatus(props) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleStatusChange(status) {
      setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
    }
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    // Specify how to clean up after this effect:
    return function cleanup() {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });
  if (isOnline === null) {
    return 'Loading...';
  }
  return isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';
} Why did we return a function from our effect? This is the optional cleanup mechanism for effects. Every effect may return a function that cleans up after it. This lets us keep the logic for adding and removing subscriptions close to each other. They’re part of the same effect! When exactly does React clean up an effect? React performs the cleanup when the component unmounts. However, as we learned earlier, effects run for every render and not just once. This is why React also cleans up effects from the previous render before running the effects next time. We’ll discuss why this helps avoid bugs and how to opt out of this behavior in case it creates performance issues later below.  Note We don’t have to return a named function from the effect. We called it cleanup here to clarify its purpose, but you could return an arrow function or call it something different.  Recap  We’ve learned that useEffect lets us express different kinds of side effects after a component renders. Some effects might require cleanup so they return a function:   useEffect(() => {
    function handleStatusChange(status) {
      setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
    }
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  }); Other effects might not have a cleanup phase, and don’t return anything.   useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  }); The Effect Hook unifies both use cases with a single API. If you feel like you have a decent grasp on how the Effect Hook works, or if you feel overwhelmed, you can jump to the next page about Rules of Hooks now. Tips for Using Effects  We’ll continue this page with an in-depth look at some aspects of useEffect that experienced React users will likely be curious about. Don’t feel obligated to dig into them now. You can always come back to this page to learn more details about the Effect Hook. Tip: Use Multiple Effects to Separate Concerns  One of the problems we outlined in the Motivation for Hooks is that class lifecycle methods often contain unrelated logic, but related logic gets broken up into several methods. Here is a component that combines the counter and the friend status indicator logic from the previous examples: class FriendStatusWithCounter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { count: 0, isOnline: null };
    this.handleStatusChange = this.handleStatusChange.bind(this);
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(
      this.props.friend.id,
      this.handleStatusChange
    );
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(
      this.props.friend.id,
      this.handleStatusChange
    );
  }
  handleStatusChange(status) {
    this.setState({
      isOnline: status.isOnline
    });
  }
  // ... Note how the logic that sets document.title is split between componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. The subscription logic is also spread between componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount. And componentDidMount contains code for both tasks. So, how can Hooks solve this problem? Just like you can use the State Hook more than once, you can also use several effects. This lets us separate unrelated logic into different effects: function FriendStatusWithCounter(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleStatusChange(status) {
      setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
    }
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });
  // ...
} Hooks let us split the code based on what it is doing rather than a lifecycle method name. React will apply every effect used by the component, in the order they were specified. Explanation: Why Effects Run on Each Update  If you’re used to classes, you might be wondering why the effect cleanup phase happens after every re-render, and not just once during unmounting. Let’s look at a practical example to see why this design helps us create components with fewer bugs. Earlier on this page, we introduced an example FriendStatus component that displays whether a friend is online or not. Our class reads friend.id from this.props, subscribes to the friend status after the component mounts, and unsubscribes during unmounting:   componentDidMount() {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(
      this.props.friend.id,
      this.handleStatusChange
    );
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(
      this.props.friend.id,
      this.handleStatusChange
    );
  } But what happens if the friend prop changes while the component is on the screen? Our component would continue displaying the online status of a different friend. This is a bug. We would also cause a memory leak or crash when unmounting since the unsubscribe call would use the wrong friend ID. In a class component, we would need to add componentDidUpdate to handle this case:   componentDidMount() {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(
      this.props.friend.id,
      this.handleStatusChange
    );
  }
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
    // Unsubscribe from the previous friend.id
    ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(
      prevProps.friend.id,
      this.handleStatusChange
    );
    // Subscribe to the next friend.id
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(
      this.props.friend.id,
      this.handleStatusChange
    );
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(
      this.props.friend.id,
      this.handleStatusChange
    );
  } Forgetting to handle componentDidUpdate properly is a common source of bugs in React applications. Now consider the version of this component that uses Hooks: function FriendStatus(props) {
  // ...
  useEffect(() => {
    // ...
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  }); It doesn’t suffer from this bug. (But we also didn’t make any changes to it.) There is no special code for handling updates because useEffect handles them by default. It cleans up the previous effects before applying the next effects. To illustrate this, here is a sequence of subscribe and unsubscribe calls that this component could produce over time: // Mount with { friend: { id: 100 } } props
ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(100, handleStatusChange);     // Run first effect
// Update with { friend: { id: 200 } } props
ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(100, handleStatusChange); // Clean up previous effect
ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(200, handleStatusChange);     // Run next effect
// Update with { friend: { id: 300 } } props
ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(200, handleStatusChange); // Clean up previous effect
ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(300, handleStatusChange);     // Run next effect
// Unmount
ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(300, handleStatusChange); // Clean up last effect This behavior ensures consistency by default and prevents bugs that are common in class components due to missing update logic. Tip: Optimizing Performance by Skipping Effects  In some cases, cleaning up or applying the effect after every render might create a performance problem. In class components, we can solve this by writing an extra comparison with prevProps or prevState inside componentDidUpdate: componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
  if (prevState.count !== this.state.count) {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
  }
} This requirement is common enough that it is built into the useEffect Hook API. You can tell React to skip applying an effect if certain values haven’t changed between re-renders. To do so, pass an array as an optional second argument to useEffect: useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
}, [count]); // Only re-run the effect if count changes
 In the example above, we pass [count] as the second argument. What does this mean? If the count is 5, and then our component re-renders with count still equal to 5, React will compare [5] from the previous render and [5] from the next render. Because all items in the array are the same (5 === 5), React would skip the effect. That’s our optimization. When we render with count updated to 6, React will compare the items in the [5] array from the previous render to items in the [6] array from the next render. This time, React will re-apply the effect because 5 !== 6. If there are multiple items in the array, React will re-run the effect even if just one of them is different. This also works for effects that have a cleanup phase: useEffect(() => {
  function handleStatusChange(status) {
    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
  }
  ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
  return () => {
    ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
  };
}, [props.friend.id]); // Only re-subscribe if props.friend.id changes
 In the future, the second argument might get added automatically by a build-time transformation.  Note If you use this optimization, make sure the array includes all values from the component scope (such as props and state) that change over time and that are used by the effect. Otherwise, your code will reference stale values from previous renders. Learn more about how to deal with functions and what to do when the array changes too often. If you want to run an effect and clean it up only once (on mount and unmount), you can pass an empty array ([]) as a second argument. This tells React that your effect doesn’t depend on any values from props or state, so it never needs to re-run. This isn’t handled as a special case — it follows directly from how the dependencies array always works. If you pass an empty array ([]), the props and state inside the effect will always have their initial values. While passing [] as the second argument is closer to the familiar componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount mental model, there are usually better solutions to avoid re-running effects too often. Also, don’t forget that React defers running useEffect until after the browser has painted, so doing extra work is less of a problem. We recommend using the exhaustive-deps rule as part of our eslint-plugin-react-hooks package. It warns when dependencies are specified incorrectly and suggests a fix.  Next Steps  Congratulations! This was a long page, but hopefully by the end most of your questions about effects were answered. You’ve learned both the State Hook and the Effect Hook, and there is a lot you can do with both of them combined. They cover most of the use cases for classes — and where they don’t, you might find the additional Hooks helpful. We’re also starting to see how Hooks solve problems outlined in Motivation. We’ve seen how effect cleanup avoids duplication in componentDidUpdate and componentWillUnmount, brings related code closer together, and helps us avoid bugs. We’ve also seen how we can separate effects by their purpose, which is something we couldn’t do in classes at all. At this point you might be questioning how Hooks work. How can React know which useState call corresponds to which state variable between re-renders? How does React “match up” previous and next effects on every update? On the next page we will learn about the Rules of Hooks — they’re essential to making Hooks work.

How do I implement shouldComponentUpdate? How to memoize calculations? How to create expensive objects lazily? Are Hooks slow because of creating functions in render? How to avoid passing callbacks down? How to read an often-changing value from useCallback?    Under the Hood  How does React associate Hook calls with components? What is the prior art for Hooks?    Adoption Strategy  Which versions of React include Hooks?  Starting with 16.8.0, React includes a stable implementation of React Hooks for:  React DOM React Native React DOM Server React Test Renderer React Shallow Renderer  Note that to enable Hooks, all React packages need to be 16.8.0 or higher. Hooks won’t work if you forget to update, for example, React DOM. React Native 0.59 and above support Hooks. Do I need to rewrite all my class components?  No. There are no plans to remove classes from React — we all need to keep shipping products and can’t afford rewrites. We recommend trying Hooks in new code. What can I do with Hooks that I couldn’t with classes?  Hooks offer a powerful and expressive new way to reuse functionality between components. “Building Your Own Hooks” provides a glimpse of what’s possible. This article by a React core team member dives deeper into the new capabilities unlocked by Hooks. How much of my React knowledge stays relevant?  Hooks are a more direct way to use the React features you already know — such as state, lifecycle, context, and refs. They don’t fundamentally change how React works, and your knowledge of components, props, and top-down data flow is just as relevant. Hooks do have a learning curve of their own. If there’s something missing in this documentation, raise an issue and we’ll try to help. Should I use Hooks, classes, or a mix of both?  When you’re ready, we’d encourage you to start trying Hooks in new components you write. Make sure everyone on your team is on board with using them and familiar with this documentation. We don’t recommend rewriting your existing classes to Hooks unless you planned to rewrite them anyway (e.g. to fix bugs). You can’t use Hooks inside a class component, but you can definitely mix classes and function components with Hooks in a single tree. Whether a component is a class or a function that uses Hooks is an implementation detail of that component. In the longer term, we expect Hooks to be the primary way people write React components. Do Hooks cover all use cases for classes?  Our goal is for Hooks to cover all use cases for classes as soon as possible. There are no Hook equivalents to the uncommon getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, getDerivedStateFromError and componentDidCatch lifecycles yet, but we plan to add them soon. Do Hooks replace render props and higher-order components?  Often, render props and higher-order components render only a single child. We think Hooks are a simpler way to serve this use case. There is still a place for both patterns (for example, a virtual scroller component might have a renderItem prop, or a visual container component might have its own DOM structure). But in most cases, Hooks will be sufficient and can help reduce nesting in your tree. What do Hooks mean for popular APIs like Redux connect() and React Router?  You can continue to use the exact same APIs as you always have; they’ll continue to work. React Redux since v7.1.0 supports Hooks API and exposes hooks like useDispatch or useSelector. React Router supports hooks since v5.1. Other libraries might support hooks in the future too. Do Hooks work with static typing?  Hooks were designed with static typing in mind. Because they’re functions, they are easier to type correctly than patterns like higher-order components. The latest Flow and TypeScript React definitions include support for React Hooks. Importantly, custom Hooks give you the power to constrain React API if you’d like to type them more strictly in some way. React gives you the primitives, but you can combine them in different ways than what we provide out of the box. How to test components that use Hooks?  From React’s point of view, a component using Hooks is just a regular component. If your testing solution doesn’t rely on React internals, testing components with Hooks shouldn’t be different from how you normally test components.  Note Testing Recipes include many examples that you can copy and paste.  For example, let’s say we have this counter component: function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
} We’ll test it using React DOM. To make sure that the behavior matches what happens in the browser, we’ll wrap the code rendering and updating it into ReactTestUtils.act() calls: import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { act } from 'react-dom/test-utils';
import Counter from './Counter';
let container;
beforeEach(() => {
  container = document.createElement('div');
  document.body.appendChild(container);
});
afterEach(() => {
  document.body.removeChild(container);
  container = null;
});
it('can render and update a counter', () => {
  // Test first render and effect
  act(() => {
    ReactDOM.render(<Counter />, container);
  });
  const button = container.querySelector('button');
  const label = container.querySelector('p');
  expect(label.textContent).toBe('You clicked 0 times');
  expect(document.title).toBe('You clicked 0 times');
  // Test second render and effect
  act(() => {
    button.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent('click', {bubbles: true}));
  });
  expect(label.textContent).toBe('You clicked 1 times');
  expect(document.title).toBe('You clicked 1 times');
}); The calls to act() will also flush the effects inside of them. If you need to test a custom Hook, you can do so by creating a component in your test, and using your Hook from it. Then you can test the component you wrote. To reduce the boilerplate, we recommend using React Testing Library which is designed to encourage writing tests that use your components as the end users do. For more information, check out Testing Recipes. What exactly do the lint rules enforce?  We provide an ESLint plugin that enforces rules of Hooks to avoid bugs. It assumes that any function starting with ”use” and a capital letter right after it is a Hook. We recognize this heuristic isn’t perfect and there may be some false positives, but without an ecosystem-wide convention there is just no way to make Hooks work well — and longer names will discourage people from either adopting Hooks or following the convention. In particular, the rule enforces that:  Calls to Hooks are either inside a PascalCase function (assumed to be a component) or another useSomething function (assumed to be a custom Hook). Hooks are called in the same order on every render.  There are a few more heuristics, and they might change over time as we fine-tune the rule to balance finding bugs with avoiding false positives. From Classes to Hooks  How do lifecycle methods correspond to Hooks?   
constructor: Function components don’t need a constructor. You can initialize the state in the useState call. If computing the initial state is expensive, you can pass a function to useState. 
getDerivedStateFromProps: Schedule an update while rendering instead. 
shouldComponentUpdate: See React.memo below. 
render: This is the function component body itself. 
componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, componentWillUnmount: The useEffect Hook can express all combinations of these (including less common cases). 
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate, componentDidCatch and getDerivedStateFromError: There are no Hook equivalents for these methods yet, but they will be added soon.  How can I do data fetching with Hooks?  Here is a small demo to get you started. To learn more, check out this article about data fetching with Hooks. Is there something like instance variables?  Yes! The useRef() Hook isn’t just for DOM refs. The “ref” object is a generic container whose current property is mutable and can hold any value, similar to an instance property on a class. You can write to it from inside useEffect: function Timer() {
  const intervalRef = useRef();
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      // ...
    });
    intervalRef.current = id;
    return () => {
      clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
    };
  });
  // ...
} If we just wanted to set an interval, we wouldn’t need the ref (id could be local to the effect), but it’s useful if we want to clear the interval from an event handler:   // ...
  function handleCancelClick() {
    clearInterval(intervalRef.current);
  }
  // ... Conceptually, you can think of refs as similar to instance variables in a class. Unless you’re doing lazy initialization, avoid setting refs during rendering — this can lead to surprising behavior. Instead, typically you want to modify refs in event handlers and effects. Should I use one or many state variables?  If you’re coming from classes, you might be tempted to always call useState() once and put all state into a single object. You can do it if you’d like. Here is an example of a component that follows the mouse movement. We keep its position and size in the local state: function Box() {
  const [state, setState] = useState({ left: 0, top: 0, width: 100, height: 100 });
  // ...
} Now let’s say we want to write some logic that changes left and top when the user moves their mouse. Note how we have to merge these fields into the previous state object manually:   // ...
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleWindowMouseMove(e) {
      // Spreading "...state" ensures we don't "lose" width and height
      setState(state => ({ ...state, left: e.pageX, top: e.pageY }));
    }
    // Note: this implementation is a bit simplified
    window.addEventListener('mousemove', handleWindowMouseMove);
    return () => window.removeEventListener('mousemove', handleWindowMouseMove);
  }, []);
  // ... This is because when we update a state variable, we replace its value. This is different from this.setState in a class, which merges the updated fields into the object. If you miss automatic merging, you could write a custom useLegacyState Hook that merges object state updates. However, we recommend to split state into multiple state variables based on which values tend to change together. For example, we could split our component state into position and size objects, and always replace the position with no need for merging: function Box() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ left: 0, top: 0 });
  const [size, setSize] = useState({ width: 100, height: 100 });
  useEffect(() => {
    function handleWindowMouseMove(e) {
      setPosition({ left: e.pageX, top: e.pageY });
    }
    // ... Separating independent state variables also has another benefit. It makes it easy to later extract some related logic into a custom Hook, for example: function Box() {
  const position = useWindowPosition();
  const [size, setSize] = useState({ width: 100, height: 100 });
  // ...
}
function useWindowPosition() {
  const [position, setPosition] = useState({ left: 0, top: 0 });
  useEffect(() => {
    // ...
  }, []);
  return position;
} Note how we were able to move the useState call for the position state variable and the related effect into a custom Hook without changing their code. If all state was in a single object, extracting it would be more difficult. Both putting all state in a single useState call, and having a useState call per each field can work. Components tend to be most readable when you find a balance between these two extremes, and group related state into a few independent state variables. If the state logic becomes complex, we recommend managing it with a reducer or a custom Hook. Can I run an effect only on updates?  This is a rare use case. If you need it, you can use a mutable ref to manually store a boolean value corresponding to whether you are on the first or a subsequent render, then check that flag in your effect. (If you find yourself doing this often, you could create a custom Hook for it.) How to get the previous props or state?  Currently, you can do it manually with a ref: function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const prevCountRef = useRef();
  useEffect(() => {
    prevCountRef.current = count;
  });
  const prevCount = prevCountRef.current;
  return <h1>Now: {count}, before: {prevCount}</h1>;
} This might be a bit convoluted but you can extract it into a custom Hook: function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const prevCount = usePrevious(count);
  return <h1>Now: {count}, before: {prevCount}</h1>;
}
function usePrevious(value) {
  const ref = useRef();
  useEffect(() => {
    ref.current = value;
  });
  return ref.current;
} Note how this would work for props, state, or any other calculated value. function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const calculation = count + 100;
  const prevCalculation = usePrevious(calculation);
  // ... It’s possible that in the future React will provide a usePrevious Hook out of the box since it’s a relatively common use case. See also the recommended pattern for derived state. Why am I seeing stale props or state inside my function?  Any function inside a component, including event handlers and effects, “sees” the props and state from the render it was created in. For example, consider code like this: function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  function handleAlertClick() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      alert('You clicked on: ' + count);
    }, 3000);
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
      <button onClick={handleAlertClick}>
        Show alert
      </button>
    </div>
  );
} If you first click “Show alert” and then increment the counter, the alert will show the count variable at the time you clicked the “Show alert” button. This prevents bugs caused by the code assuming props and state don’t change. If you intentionally want to read the latest state from some asynchronous callback, you could keep it in a ref, mutate it, and read from it. Finally, another possible reason you’re seeing stale props or state is if you use the “dependency array” optimization but didn’t correctly specify all the dependencies. For example, if an effect specifies [] as the second argument but reads someProp inside, it will keep “seeing” the initial value of someProp. The solution is to either remove the dependency array, or to fix it. Here’s how you can deal with functions, and here’s other common strategies to run effects less often without incorrectly skipping dependencies.  Note We provide an exhaustive-deps ESLint rule as a part of the eslint-plugin-react-hooks package. It warns when dependencies are specified incorrectly and suggests a fix.  How do I implement getDerivedStateFromProps?  While you probably don’t need it, in rare cases that you do (such as implementing a <Transition> component), you can update the state right during rendering. React will re-run the component with updated state immediately after exiting the first render so it wouldn’t be expensive. Here, we store the previous value of the row prop in a state variable so that we can compare: function ScrollView({row}) {
  const [isScrollingDown, setIsScrollingDown] = useState(false);
  const [prevRow, setPrevRow] = useState(null);
  if (row !== prevRow) {
    // Row changed since last render. Update isScrollingDown.
    setIsScrollingDown(prevRow !== null && row > prevRow);
    setPrevRow(row);
  }
  return `Scrolling down: ${isScrollingDown}`;
} This might look strange at first, but an update during rendering is exactly what getDerivedStateFromProps has always been like conceptually. Is there something like forceUpdate?  Both useState and useReducer Hooks bail out of updates if the next value is the same as the previous one. Mutating state in place and calling setState will not cause a re-render. Normally, you shouldn’t mutate local state in React. However, as an escape hatch, you can use an incrementing counter to force a re-render even if the state has not changed:   const [ignored, forceUpdate] = useReducer(x => x + 1, 0);
  function handleClick() {
    forceUpdate();
  } Try to avoid this pattern if possible. Can I make a ref to a function component?  While you shouldn’t need this often, you may expose some imperative methods to a parent component with the useImperativeHandle Hook. How can I measure a DOM node?  One rudimentary way to measure the position or size of a DOM node is to use a callback ref. React will call that callback whenever the ref gets attached to a different node. Here is a small demo: function MeasureExample() {
  const [height, setHeight] = useState(0);
  const measuredRef = useCallback(node => {
    if (node !== null) {
      setHeight(node.getBoundingClientRect().height);
    }
  }, []);
  return (
    <>
      <h1 ref={measuredRef}>Hello, world</h1>
      <h2>The above header is {Math.round(height)}px tall</h2>
    </>
  );
} We didn’t choose useRef in this example because an object ref doesn’t notify us about changes to the current ref value. Using a callback ref ensures that even if a child component displays the measured node later (e.g. in response to a click), we still get notified about it in the parent component and can update the measurements. Note that we pass [] as a dependency array to useCallback. This ensures that our ref callback doesn’t change between the re-renders, and so React won’t call it unnecessarily. In this example, the callback ref will be called only when the component mounts and unmounts, since the rendered <h1> component stays present throughout any rerenders. If you want to be notified any time a component resizes, you may want to use ResizeObserver or a third-party Hook built on it. If you want, you can extract this logic into a reusable Hook: function MeasureExample() {
  const [rect, ref] = useClientRect();
  return (
    <>
      <h1 ref={ref}>Hello, world</h1>
      {rect !== null &&
        <h2>The above header is {Math.round(rect.height)}px tall</h2>
      }
    </>
  );
}
function useClientRect() {
  const [rect, setRect] = useState(null);
  const ref = useCallback(node => {
    if (node !== null) {
      setRect(node.getBoundingClientRect());
    }
  }, []);
  return [rect, ref];
} What does const [thing, setThing] = useState() mean?  If you’re not familiar with this syntax, check out the explanation in the State Hook documentation. Performance Optimizations  Can I skip an effect on updates?  Yes. See conditionally firing an effect. Note that forgetting to handle updates often introduces bugs, which is why this isn’t the default behavior. Is it safe to omit functions from the list of dependencies?  Generally speaking, no. function Example({ someProp }) {
  function doSomething() {
    console.log(someProp);
  }
  useEffect(() => {
    doSomething();
  }, []); // 🔴 This is not safe (it calls `doSomething` which uses `someProp`)
} It’s difficult to remember which props or state are used by functions outside of the effect. This is why usually you’ll want to declare functions needed by an effect inside of it. Then it’s easy to see what values from the component scope that effect depends on: function Example({ someProp }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    function doSomething() {
      console.log(someProp);
    }
    doSomething();
  }, [someProp]); // ✅ OK (our effect only uses `someProp`)
} If after that we still don’t use any values from the component scope, it’s safe to specify []: useEffect(() => {
  function doSomething() {
    console.log('hello');
  }
  doSomething();
}, []); // ✅ OK in this example because we don't use *any* values from component scope
 Depending on your use case, there are a few more options described below.  Note We provide the exhaustive-deps ESLint rule as a part of the eslint-plugin-react-hooks package. It helps you find components that don’t handle updates consistently.  Let’s see why this matters. If you specify a list of dependencies as the last argument to useEffect, useLayoutEffect, useMemo, useCallback, or useImperativeHandle, it must include all values that are used inside the callback and participate in the React data flow. That includes props, state, and anything derived from them. It is only safe to omit a function from the dependency list if nothing in it (or the functions called by it) references props, state, or values derived from them. This example has a bug: function ProductPage({ productId }) {
  const [product, setProduct] = useState(null);
  async function fetchProduct() {
    const response = await fetch('http://myapi/product/' + productId); // Uses productId prop
    const json = await response.json();
    setProduct(json);
  }
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchProduct();
  }, []); // 🔴 Invalid because `fetchProduct` uses `productId`
  // ...
} The recommended fix is to move that function inside of your effect. That makes it easy to see which props or state your effect uses, and to ensure they’re all declared: function ProductPage({ productId }) {
  const [product, setProduct] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    // By moving this function inside the effect, we can clearly see the values it uses.
    async function fetchProduct() {
      const response = await fetch('http://myapi/product/' + productId);
      const json = await response.json();
      setProduct(json);
    }
    fetchProduct();
  }, [productId]); // ✅ Valid because our effect only uses productId
  // ...
} This also allows you to handle out-of-order responses with a local variable inside the effect:   useEffect(() => {
    let ignore = false;
    async function fetchProduct() {
      const response = await fetch('http://myapi/product/' + productId);
      const json = await response.json();
      if (!ignore) setProduct(json);
    }
    fetchProduct();
    return () => { ignore = true };
  }, [productId]); We moved the function inside the effect so it doesn’t need to be in its dependency list.  Tip Check out this small demo and this article to learn more about data fetching with Hooks.  If for some reason you can’t move a function inside an effect, there are a few more options:  
You can try moving that function outside of your component. In that case, the function is guaranteed to not reference any props or state, and also doesn’t need to be in the list of dependencies. If the function you’re calling is a pure computation and is safe to call while rendering, you may call it outside of the effect instead, and make the effect depend on the returned value. As a last resort, you can add a function to effect dependencies but wrap its definition into the useCallback Hook. This ensures it doesn’t change on every render unless its own dependencies also change:  function ProductPage({ productId }) {
  // ✅ Wrap with useCallback to avoid change on every render
  const fetchProduct = useCallback(() => {
    // ... Does something with productId ...
  }, [productId]); // ✅ All useCallback dependencies are specified
  return <ProductDetails fetchProduct={fetchProduct} />;
}
function ProductDetails({ fetchProduct }) {
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchProduct();
  }, [fetchProduct]); // ✅ All useEffect dependencies are specified
  // ...
} Note that in the above example we need to keep the function in the dependencies list. This ensures that a change in the productId prop of ProductPage automatically triggers a refetch in the ProductDetails component. What can I do if my effect dependencies change too often?  Sometimes, your effect may be using state that changes too often. You might be tempted to omit that state from a list of dependencies, but that usually leads to bugs: function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(count + 1); // This effect depends on the `count` state
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []); // 🔴 Bug: `count` is not specified as a dependency
  return <h1>{count}</h1>;
} The empty set of dependencies, [], means that the effect will only run once when the component mounts, and not on every re-render. The problem is that inside the setInterval callback, the value of count does not change, because we’ve created a closure with the value of count set to 0 as it was when the effect callback ran. Every second, this callback then calls setCount(0 + 1), so the count never goes above 1. Specifying [count] as a list of dependencies would fix the bug, but would cause the interval to be reset on every change. Effectively, each setInterval would get one chance to execute before being cleared (similar to a setTimeout.) That may not be desirable. To fix this, we can use the functional update form of setState. It lets us specify how the state needs to change without referencing the current state: function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    const id = setInterval(() => {
      setCount(c => c + 1); // ✅ This doesn't depend on `count` variable outside
    }, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []); // ✅ Our effect doesn't use any variables in the component scope
  return <h1>{count}</h1>;
} (The identity of the setCount function is guaranteed to be stable so it’s safe to omit.) Now, the setInterval callback executes once a second, but each time the inner call to setCount can use an up-to-date value for count (called c in the callback here.) In more complex cases (such as if one state depends on another state), try moving the state update logic outside the effect with the useReducer Hook. This article offers an example of how you can do this. The identity of the dispatch function from useReducer is always stable — even if the reducer function is declared inside the component and reads its props. As a last resort, if you want something like this in a class, you can use a ref to hold a mutable variable. Then you can write and read to it. For example: function Example(props) {
  // Keep latest props in a ref.
  const latestProps = useRef(props);
  useEffect(() => {
    latestProps.current = props;
  });
  useEffect(() => {
    function tick() {
      // Read latest props at any time
      console.log(latestProps.current);
    }
    const id = setInterval(tick, 1000);
    return () => clearInterval(id);
  }, []); // This effect never re-runs
} Only do this if you couldn’t find a better alternative, as relying on mutation makes components less predictable. If there’s a specific pattern that doesn’t translate well, file an issue with a runnable example code and we can try to help. How do I implement shouldComponentUpdate?  You can wrap a function component with React.memo to shallowly compare its props: const Button = React.memo((props) => {
  // your component
}); It’s not a Hook because it doesn’t compose like Hooks do. React.memo is equivalent to PureComponent, but it only compares props. (You can also add a second argument to specify a custom comparison function that takes the old and new props. If it returns true, the update is skipped.) React.memo doesn’t compare state because there is no single state object to compare. But you can make children pure too, or even optimize individual children with useMemo. How to memoize calculations?  The useMemo Hook lets you cache calculations between multiple renders by “remembering” the previous computation: const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]); This code calls computeExpensiveValue(a, b). But if the dependencies [a, b] haven’t changed since the last value, useMemo skips calling it a second time and simply reuses the last value it returned. Remember that the function passed to useMemo runs during rendering. Don’t do anything there that you wouldn’t normally do while rendering. For example, side effects belong in useEffect, not useMemo. You may rely on useMemo as a performance optimization, not as a semantic guarantee. In the future, React may choose to “forget” some previously memoized values and recalculate them on next render, e.g. to free memory for offscreen components. Write your code so that it still works without useMemo — and then add it to optimize performance. (For rare cases when a value must never be recomputed, you can lazily initialize a ref.) Conveniently, useMemo also lets you skip an expensive re-render of a child: function Parent({ a, b }) {
  // Only re-rendered if `a` changes:
  const child1 = useMemo(() => <Child1 a={a} />, [a]);
  // Only re-rendered if `b` changes:
  const child2 = useMemo(() => <Child2 b={b} />, [b]);
  return (
    <>
      {child1}
      {child2}
    </>
  )
} Note that this approach won’t work in a loop because Hook calls can’t be placed inside loops. But you can extract a separate component for the list item, and call useMemo there. How to create expensive objects lazily?  useMemo lets you memoize an expensive calculation if the dependencies are the same. However, it only serves as a hint, and doesn’t guarantee the computation won’t re-run. But sometimes you need to be sure an object is only created once. The first common use case is when creating the initial state is expensive: function Table(props) {
  // ⚠️ createRows() is called on every render
  const [rows, setRows] = useState(createRows(props.count));
  // ...
} To avoid re-creating the ignored initial state, we can pass a function to useState: function Table(props) {
  // ✅ createRows() is only called once
  const [rows, setRows] = useState(() => createRows(props.count));
  // ...
} React will only call this function during the first render. See the useState API reference. You might also occasionally want to avoid re-creating the useRef() initial value. For example, maybe you want to ensure some imperative class instance only gets created once: function Image(props) {
  // ⚠️ IntersectionObserver is created on every render
  const ref = useRef(new IntersectionObserver(onIntersect));
  // ...
} useRef does not accept a special function overload like useState. Instead, you can write your own function that creates and sets it lazily: function Image(props) {
  const ref = useRef(null);
  // ✅ IntersectionObserver is created lazily once
  function getObserver() {
    if (ref.current === null) {
      ref.current = new IntersectionObserver(onIntersect);
    }
    return ref.current;
  }
  // When you need it, call getObserver()
  // ...
} This avoids creating an expensive object until it’s truly needed for the first time. If you use Flow or TypeScript, you can also give getObserver() a non-nullable type for convenience. Are Hooks slow because of creating functions in render?  No. In modern browsers, the raw performance of closures compared to classes doesn’t differ significantly except in extreme scenarios. In addition, consider that the design of Hooks is more efficient in a couple ways:  Hooks avoid a lot of the overhead that classes require, like the cost of creating class instances and binding event handlers in the constructor. 
Idiomatic code using Hooks doesn’t need the deep component tree nesting that is prevalent in codebases that use higher-order components, render props, and context. With smaller component trees, React has less work to do.  Traditionally, performance concerns around inline functions in React have been related to how passing new callbacks on each render breaks shouldComponentUpdate optimizations in child components. Hooks approach this problem from three sides.   The useCallback Hook lets you keep the same callback reference between re-renders so that shouldComponentUpdate continues to work: // Will not change unless `a` or `b` changes
const memoizedCallback = useCallback(() => {
  doSomething(a, b);
}, [a, b]);  The useMemo Hook makes it easier to control when individual children update, reducing the need for pure components. Finally, the useReducer Hook reduces the need to pass callbacks deeply, as explained below.  How to avoid passing callbacks down?  We’ve found that most people don’t enjoy manually passing callbacks through every level of a component tree. Even though it is more explicit, it can feel like a lot of “plumbing”. In large component trees, an alternative we recommend is to pass down a dispatch function from useReducer via context: const TodosDispatch = React.createContext(null);
function TodosApp() {
  // Note: `dispatch` won't change between re-renders
  const [todos, dispatch] = useReducer(todosReducer);
  return (
    <TodosDispatch.Provider value={dispatch}>
      <DeepTree todos={todos} />
    </TodosDispatch.Provider>
  );
} Any child in the tree inside TodosApp can use the dispatch function to pass actions up to TodosApp: function DeepChild(props) {
  // If we want to perform an action, we can get dispatch from context.
  const dispatch = useContext(TodosDispatch);
  function handleClick() {
    dispatch({ type: 'add', text: 'hello' });
  }
  return (
    <button onClick={handleClick}>Add todo</button>
  );
} This is both more convenient from the maintenance perspective (no need to keep forwarding callbacks), and avoids the callback problem altogether. Passing dispatch down like this is the recommended pattern for deep updates. Note that you can still choose whether to pass the application state down as props (more explicit) or as context (more convenient for very deep updates). If you use context to pass down the state too, use two different context types — the dispatch context never changes, so components that read it don’t need to rerender unless they also need the application state. How to read an often-changing value from useCallback?   Note We recommend to pass dispatch down in context rather than individual callbacks in props. The approach below is only mentioned here for completeness and as an escape hatch.  In some rare cases you might need to memoize a callback with useCallback but the memoization doesn’t work very well because the inner function has to be re-created too often. If the function you’re memoizing is an event handler and isn’t used during rendering, you can use ref as an instance variable, and save the last committed value into it manually: function Form() {
  const [text, updateText] = useState('');
  const textRef = useRef();
  useEffect(() => {
    textRef.current = text; // Write it to the ref
  });
  const handleSubmit = useCallback(() => {
    const currentText = textRef.current; // Read it from the ref
    alert(currentText);
  }, [textRef]); // Don't recreate handleSubmit like [text] would do
  return (
    <>
      <input value={text} onChange={e => updateText(e.target.value)} />
      <ExpensiveTree onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
    </>
  );
} This is a rather convoluted pattern but it shows that you can do this escape hatch optimization if you need it. It’s more bearable if you extract it to a custom Hook: function Form() {
  const [text, updateText] = useState('');
  // Will be memoized even if `text` changes:
  const handleSubmit = useEventCallback(() => {
    alert(text);
  }, [text]);
  return (
    <>
      <input value={text} onChange={e => updateText(e.target.value)} />
      <ExpensiveTree onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
    </>
  );
}
function useEventCallback(fn, dependencies) {
  const ref = useRef(() => {
    throw new Error('Cannot call an event handler while rendering.');
  });
  useEffect(() => {
    ref.current = fn;
  }, [fn, ...dependencies]);
  return useCallback(() => {
    const fn = ref.current;
    return fn();
  }, [ref]);
} In either case, we don’t recommend this pattern and only show it here for completeness. Instead, it is preferable to avoid passing callbacks deep down. Under the Hood  How does React associate Hook calls with components?  React keeps track of the currently rendering component. Thanks to the Rules of Hooks, we know that Hooks are only called from React components (or custom Hooks — which are also only called from React components). There is an internal list of “memory cells” associated with each component. They’re just JavaScript objects where we can put some data. When you call a Hook like useState(), it reads the current cell (or initializes it during the first render), and then moves the pointer to the next one. This is how multiple useState() calls each get independent local state. What is the prior art for Hooks?  Hooks synthesize ideas from several different sources:  Our old experiments with functional APIs in the react-future repository. React community’s experiments with render prop APIs, including Ryan Florence’s Reactions Component. 
Dominic Gannaway’s adopt keyword proposal as a sugar syntax for render props. State variables and state cells in DisplayScript. 
Reducer components in ReasonReact. 
Subscriptions in Rx. 
Algebraic effects in Multicore OCaml.  Sebastian Markbåge came up with the original design for Hooks, later refined by Andrew Clark, Sophie Alpert, Dominic Gannaway, and other members of the React team.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Introducing Hooks
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. import React, { useState } from 'react';
function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
} This new function useState is the first “Hook” we’ll learn about, but this example is just a teaser. Don’t worry if it doesn’t make sense yet! You can start learning Hooks on the next page. On this page, we’ll continue by explaining why we’re adding Hooks to React and how they can help you write great applications.  Note React 16.8.0 is the first release to support Hooks. When upgrading, don’t forget to update all packages, including React DOM. React Native supports Hooks since the 0.59 release of React Native.  Video Introduction  At React Conf 2018, Sophie Alpert and Dan Abramov introduced Hooks, followed by Ryan Florence demonstrating how to refactor an application to use them. Watch the video here:     No Breaking Changes  Before we continue, note that Hooks are:  
Completely opt-in. You can try Hooks in a few components without rewriting any existing code. But you don’t have to learn or use Hooks right now if you don’t want to. 
100% backwards-compatible. Hooks don’t contain any breaking changes. 
Available now. Hooks are now available with the release of v16.8.0.  There are no plans to remove classes from React. You can read more about the gradual adoption strategy for Hooks in the bottom section of this page. Hooks don’t replace your knowledge of React concepts. Instead, Hooks provide a more direct API to the React concepts you already know: props, state, context, refs, and lifecycle. As we will show later, Hooks also offer a new powerful way to combine them. If you just want to start learning Hooks, feel free to jump directly to the next page! You can also keep reading this page to learn more about why we’re adding Hooks, and how we’re going to start using them without rewriting our applications. Motivation  Hooks solve a wide variety of seemingly unconnected problems in React that we’ve encountered over five years of writing and maintaining tens of thousands of components. Whether you’re learning React, use it daily, or even prefer a different library with a similar component model, you might recognize some of these problems. It’s hard to reuse stateful logic between components  React doesn’t offer a way to “attach” reusable behavior to a component (for example, connecting it to a store). If you’ve worked with React for a while, you may be familiar with patterns like render props and higher-order components that try to solve this. But these patterns require you to restructure your components when you use them, which can be cumbersome and make code harder to follow. If you look at a typical React application in React DevTools, you will likely find a “wrapper hell” of components surrounded by layers of providers, consumers, higher-order components, render props, and other abstractions. While we could filter them out in DevTools, this points to a deeper underlying problem: React needs a better primitive for sharing stateful logic. With Hooks, you can extract stateful logic from a component so it can be tested independently and reused. Hooks allow you to reuse stateful logic without changing your component hierarchy. This makes it easy to share Hooks among many components or with the community. We’ll discuss this more in Building Your Own Hooks. Complex components become hard to understand  We’ve often had to maintain components that started out simple but grew into an unmanageable mess of stateful logic and side effects. Each lifecycle method often contains a mix of unrelated logic. For example, components might perform some data fetching in componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. However, the same componentDidMount method might also contain some unrelated logic that sets up event listeners, with cleanup performed in componentWillUnmount. Mutually related code that changes together gets split apart, but completely unrelated code ends up combined in a single method. This makes it too easy to introduce bugs and inconsistencies. In many cases it’s not possible to break these components into smaller ones because the stateful logic is all over the place. It’s also difficult to test them. This is one of the reasons many people prefer to combine React with a separate state management library. However, that often introduces too much abstraction, requires you to jump between different files, and makes reusing components more difficult. To solve this, Hooks let you split one component into smaller functions based on what pieces are related (such as setting up a subscription or fetching data), rather than forcing a split based on lifecycle methods. You may also opt into managing the component’s local state with a reducer to make it more predictable. We’ll discuss this more in Using the Effect Hook. Classes confuse both people and machines  In addition to making code reuse and code organization more difficult, we’ve found that classes can be a large barrier to learning React. You have to understand how this works in JavaScript, which is very different from how it works in most languages. You have to remember to bind the event handlers. Without unstable syntax proposals, the code is very verbose. People can understand props, state, and top-down data flow perfectly well but still struggle with classes. The distinction between function and class components in React and when to use each one leads to disagreements even between experienced React developers. Additionally, React has been out for about five years, and we want to make sure it stays relevant in the next five years. As Svelte, Angular, Glimmer, and others show, ahead-of-time compilation of components has a lot of future potential. Especially if it’s not limited to templates. Recently, we’ve been experimenting with component folding using Prepack, and we’ve seen promising early results. However, we found that class components can encourage unintentional patterns that make these optimizations fall back to a slower path. Classes present issues for today’s tools, too. For example, classes don’t minify very well, and they make hot reloading flaky and unreliable. We want to present an API that makes it more likely for code to stay on the optimizable path. To solve these problems, Hooks let you use more of React’s features without classes. Conceptually, React components have always been closer to functions. Hooks embrace functions, but without sacrificing the practical spirit of React. Hooks provide access to imperative escape hatches and don’t require you to learn complex functional or reactive programming techniques.  Examples Hooks at a Glance is a good place to start learning Hooks.  Gradual Adoption Strategy   TLDR: There are no plans to remove classes from React.  We know that React developers are focused on shipping products and don’t have time to look into every new API that’s being released. Hooks are very new, and it might be better to wait for more examples and tutorials before considering learning or adopting them. We also understand that the bar for adding a new primitive to React is extremely high. For curious readers, we have prepared a detailed RFC that dives into motivation with more details, and provides extra perspective on the specific design decisions and related prior art. Crucially, Hooks work side-by-side with existing code so you can adopt them gradually. There is no rush to migrate to Hooks. We recommend avoiding any “big rewrites”, especially for existing, complex class components. It takes a bit of a mind shift to start “thinking in Hooks”. In our experience, it’s best to practice using Hooks in new and non-critical components first, and ensure that everybody on your team feels comfortable with them. After you give Hooks a try, please feel free to send us feedback, positive or negative. We intend for Hooks to cover all existing use cases for classes, but we will keep supporting class components for the foreseeable future. At Facebook, we have tens of thousands of components written as classes, and we have absolutely no plans to rewrite them. Instead, we are starting to use Hooks in the new code side by side with classes. Frequently Asked Questions  We’ve prepared a Hooks FAQ page that answers the most common questions about Hooks. Next Steps  By the end of this page, you should have a rough idea of what problems Hooks are solving, but many details are probably unclear. Don’t worry! Let’s now go to the next page where we start learning about Hooks by example.

hooks-overview
-----------------------------------------------------------
Hooks at a Glance
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are backwards-compatible. This page provides an overview of Hooks for experienced React users. This is a fast-paced overview. If you get confused, look for a yellow box like this:  Detailed Explanation Read the Motivation to learn why we’re introducing Hooks to React.  ↑↑↑ Each section ends with a yellow box like this. They link to detailed explanations. 📌 State Hook  This example renders a counter. When you click the button, it increments the value: import React, { useState } from 'react';
function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
} Here, useState is a Hook (we’ll talk about what this means in a moment). We call it inside a function component to add some local state to it. React will preserve this state between re-renders. useState returns a pair: the current state value and a function that lets you update it. You can call this function from an event handler or somewhere else. It’s similar to this.setState in a class, except it doesn’t merge the old and new state together. (We’ll show an example comparing useState to this.state in Using the State Hook.) The only argument to useState is the initial state. In the example above, it is 0 because our counter starts from zero. Note that unlike this.state, the state here doesn’t have to be an object — although it can be if you want. The initial state argument is only used during the first render. Declaring multiple state variables  You can use the State Hook more than once in a single component: function ExampleWithManyStates() {
  // Declare multiple state variables!
  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);
  const [fruit, setFruit] = useState('banana');
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([{ text: 'Learn Hooks' }]);
  // ...
} The array destructuring syntax lets us give different names to the state variables we declared by calling useState. These names aren’t a part of the useState API. Instead, React assumes that if you call useState many times, you do it in the same order during every render. We’ll come back to why this works and when this is useful later. But what is a Hook?  Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React state and lifecycle features from function components. Hooks don’t work inside classes — they let you use React without classes. (We don’t recommend rewriting your existing components overnight but you can start using Hooks in the new ones if you’d like.) React provides a few built-in Hooks like useState. You can also create your own Hooks to reuse stateful behavior between different components. We’ll look at the built-in Hooks first.  Detailed Explanation You can learn more about the State Hook on a dedicated page: Using the State Hook.  ⚡️ Effect Hook  You’ve likely performed data fetching, subscriptions, or manually changing the DOM from React components before. We call these operations “side effects” (or “effects” for short) because they can affect other components and can’t be done during rendering. The Effect Hook, useEffect, adds the ability to perform side effects from a function component. It serves the same purpose as componentDidMount, componentDidUpdate, and componentWillUnmount in React classes, but unified into a single API. (We’ll show examples comparing useEffect to these methods in Using the Effect Hook.) For example, this component sets the document title after React updates the DOM: import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
function Example() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  // Similar to componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate:
  useEffect(() => {
    // Update the document title using the browser API
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
} When you call useEffect, you’re telling React to run your “effect” function after flushing changes to the DOM. Effects are declared inside the component so they have access to its props and state. By default, React runs the effects after every render — including the first render. (We’ll talk more about how this compares to class lifecycles in Using the Effect Hook.) Effects may also optionally specify how to “clean up” after them by returning a function. For example, this component uses an effect to subscribe to a friend’s online status, and cleans up by unsubscribing from it: import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
function FriendStatus(props) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);
  function handleStatusChange(status) {
    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
  }
  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });
  if (isOnline === null) {
    return 'Loading...';
  }
  return isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';
} In this example, React would unsubscribe from our ChatAPI when the component unmounts, as well as before re-running the effect due to a subsequent render. (If you want, there’s a way to tell React to skip re-subscribing if the props.friend.id we passed to ChatAPI didn’t change.) Just like with useState, you can use more than a single effect in a component: function FriendStatusWithCounter(props) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  useEffect(() => {
    document.title = `You clicked ${count} times`;
  });
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);
  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(props.friend.id, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });
  function handleStatusChange(status) {
    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
  }
  // ... Hooks let you organize side effects in a component by what pieces are related (such as adding and removing a subscription), rather than forcing a split based on lifecycle methods.  Detailed Explanation You can learn more about useEffect on a dedicated page: Using the Effect Hook.  ✌️ Rules of Hooks  Hooks are JavaScript functions, but they impose two additional rules:  Only call Hooks at the top level. Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Only call Hooks from React function components. Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. (There is just one other valid place to call Hooks — your own custom Hooks. We’ll learn about them in a moment.)  We provide a linter plugin to enforce these rules automatically. We understand these rules might seem limiting or confusing at first, but they are essential to making Hooks work well.  Detailed Explanation You can learn more about these rules on a dedicated page: Rules of Hooks.  💡 Building Your Own Hooks  Sometimes, we want to reuse some stateful logic between components. Traditionally, there were two popular solutions to this problem: higher-order components and render props. Custom Hooks let you do this, but without adding more components to your tree. Earlier on this page, we introduced a FriendStatus component that calls the useState and useEffect Hooks to subscribe to a friend’s online status. Let’s say we also want to reuse this subscription logic in another component. First, we’ll extract this logic into a custom Hook called useFriendStatus: import React, { useState, useEffect } from 'react';
function useFriendStatus(friendID) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);
  function handleStatusChange(status) {
    setIsOnline(status.isOnline);
  }
  useEffect(() => {
    ChatAPI.subscribeToFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);
    return () => {
      ChatAPI.unsubscribeFromFriendStatus(friendID, handleStatusChange);
    };
  });
  return isOnline;
} It takes friendID as an argument, and returns whether our friend is online. Now we can use it from both components: function FriendStatus(props) {
  const isOnline = useFriendStatus(props.friend.id);
  if (isOnline === null) {
    return 'Loading...';
  }
  return isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline';
} function FriendListItem(props) {
  const isOnline = useFriendStatus(props.friend.id);
  return (
    <li style={{ color: isOnline ? 'green' : 'black' }}>
      {props.friend.name}
    </li>
  );
} The state of each component is completely independent. Hooks are a way to reuse stateful logic, not state itself. In fact, each call to a Hook has a completely isolated state — so you can even use the same custom Hook twice in one component. Custom Hooks are more of a convention than a feature. If a function’s name starts with ”use” and it calls other Hooks, we say it is a custom Hook. The useSomething naming convention is how our linter plugin is able to find bugs in the code using Hooks. You can write custom Hooks that cover a wide range of use cases like form handling, animation, declarative subscriptions, timers, and probably many more we haven’t considered. We are excited to see what custom Hooks the React community will come up with.  Detailed Explanation You can learn more about custom Hooks on a dedicated page: Building Your Own Hooks.  🔌 Other Hooks  There are a few less commonly used built-in Hooks that you might find useful. For example, useContext lets you subscribe to React context without introducing nesting: function Example() {
  const locale = useContext(LocaleContext);
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  // ...
} And useReducer lets you manage local state of complex components with a reducer: function Todos() {
  const [todos, dispatch] = useReducer(todosReducer);
  // ...  Detailed Explanation You can learn more about all the built-in Hooks on a dedicated page: Hooks API Reference.  Next Steps  Phew, that was fast! If some things didn’t quite make sense or you’d like to learn more in detail, you can read the next pages, starting with the State Hook documentation. You can also check out the Hooks API reference and the Hooks FAQ. Finally, don’t miss the introduction page which explains why we’re adding Hooks and how we’ll start using them side by side with classes — without rewriting our apps.

-----------------------------------------------------------
Hooks API Reference
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. This page describes the APIs for the built-in Hooks in React. If you’re new to Hooks, you might want to check out the overview first. You may also find useful information in the frequently asked questions section.   Basic Hooks  useState useEffect useContext    Additional Hooks  useReducer useCallback useMemo useRef useImperativeHandle useLayoutEffect useDebugValue    Basic Hooks  
useState  const [state, setState] = useState(initialState); Returns a stateful value, and a function to update it. During the initial render, the returned state (state) is the same as the value passed as the first argument (initialState). The setState function is used to update the state. It accepts a new state value and enqueues a re-render of the component. setState(newState); During subsequent re-renders, the first value returned by useState will always be the most recent state after applying updates.  Note React guarantees that setState function identity is stable and won’t change on re-renders. This is why it’s safe to omit from the useEffect or useCallback dependency list.  Functional updates  If the new state is computed using the previous state, you can pass a function to setState. The function will receive the previous value, and return an updated value. Here’s an example of a counter component that uses both forms of setState: function Counter({initialCount}) {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(initialCount);
  return (
    <>
      Count: {count}
      <button onClick={() => setCount(initialCount)}>Reset</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount - 1)}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(prevCount => prevCount + 1)}>+</button>
    </>
  );
} The ”+” and ”-” buttons use the functional form, because the updated value is based on the previous value. But the “Reset” button uses the normal form, because it always sets the count back to the initial value. If your update function returns the exact same value as the current state, the subsequent rerender will be skipped completely.  Note Unlike the setState method found in class components, useState does not automatically merge update objects. You can replicate this behavior by combining the function updater form with object spread syntax: const [state, setState] = useState({});
setState(prevState => {
  // Object.assign would also work
  return {...prevState, ...updatedValues};
}); Another option is useReducer, which is more suited for managing state objects that contain multiple sub-values.  Lazy initial state  The initialState argument is the state used during the initial render. In subsequent renders, it is disregarded. If the initial state is the result of an expensive computation, you may provide a function instead, which will be executed only on the initial render: const [state, setState] = useState(() => {
  const initialState = someExpensiveComputation(props);
  return initialState;
}); Bailing out of a state update  If you update a State Hook to the same value as the current state, React will bail out without rendering the children or firing effects. (React uses the Object.is comparison algorithm.) Note that React may still need to render that specific component again before bailing out. That shouldn’t be a concern because React won’t unnecessarily go “deeper” into the tree. If you’re doing expensive calculations while rendering, you can optimize them with useMemo. 
useEffect  useEffect(didUpdate); Accepts a function that contains imperative, possibly effectful code. Mutations, subscriptions, timers, logging, and other side effects are not allowed inside the main body of a function component (referred to as React’s render phase). Doing so will lead to confusing bugs and inconsistencies in the UI. Instead, use useEffect. The function passed to useEffect will run after the render is committed to the screen. Think of effects as an escape hatch from React’s purely functional world into the imperative world. By default, effects run after every completed render, but you can choose to fire them only when certain values have changed. Cleaning up an effect  Often, effects create resources that need to be cleaned up before the component leaves the screen, such as a subscription or timer ID. To do this, the function passed to useEffect may return a clean-up function. For example, to create a subscription: useEffect(() => {
  const subscription = props.source.subscribe();
  return () => {
    // Clean up the subscription
    subscription.unsubscribe();
  };
}); The clean-up function runs before the component is removed from the UI to prevent memory leaks. Additionally, if a component renders multiple times (as they typically do), the previous effect is cleaned up before executing the next effect. In our example, this means a new subscription is created on every update. To avoid firing an effect on every update, refer to the next section. Timing of effects  Unlike componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate, the function passed to useEffect fires after layout and paint, during a deferred event. This makes it suitable for the many common side effects, like setting up subscriptions and event handlers, because most types of work shouldn’t block the browser from updating the screen. However, not all effects can be deferred. For example, a DOM mutation that is visible to the user must fire synchronously before the next paint so that the user does not perceive a visual inconsistency. (The distinction is conceptually similar to passive versus active event listeners.) For these types of effects, React provides one additional Hook called useLayoutEffect. It has the same signature as useEffect, and only differs in when it is fired. Although useEffect is deferred until after the browser has painted, it’s guaranteed to fire before any new renders. React will always flush a previous render’s effects before starting a new update. Conditionally firing an effect  The default behavior for effects is to fire the effect after every completed render. That way an effect is always recreated if one of its dependencies changes. However, this may be overkill in some cases, like the subscription example from the previous section. We don’t need to create a new subscription on every update, only if the source prop has changed. To implement this, pass a second argument to useEffect that is the array of values that the effect depends on. Our updated example now looks like this: useEffect(
  () => {
    const subscription = props.source.subscribe();
    return () => {
      subscription.unsubscribe();
    };
  },
  [props.source],
); Now the subscription will only be recreated when props.source changes.  Note If you use this optimization, make sure the array includes all values from the component scope (such as props and state) that change over time and that are used by the effect. Otherwise, your code will reference stale values from previous renders. Learn more about how to deal with functions and what to do when the array values change too often. If you want to run an effect and clean it up only once (on mount and unmount), you can pass an empty array ([]) as a second argument. This tells React that your effect doesn’t depend on any values from props or state, so it never needs to re-run. This isn’t handled as a special case — it follows directly from how the dependencies array always works. If you pass an empty array ([]), the props and state inside the effect will always have their initial values. While passing [] as the second argument is closer to the familiar componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount mental model, there are usually better solutions to avoid re-running effects too often. Also, don’t forget that React defers running useEffect until after the browser has painted, so doing extra work is less of a problem. We recommend using the exhaustive-deps rule as part of our eslint-plugin-react-hooks package. It warns when dependencies are specified incorrectly and suggests a fix.  The array of dependencies is not passed as arguments to the effect function. Conceptually, though, that’s what they represent: every value referenced inside the effect function should also appear in the dependencies array. In the future, a sufficiently advanced compiler could create this array automatically. 
useContext  const value = useContext(MyContext); Accepts a context object (the value returned from React.createContext) and returns the current context value for that context. The current context value is determined by the value prop of the nearest <MyContext.Provider> above the calling component in the tree. When the nearest <MyContext.Provider> above the component updates, this Hook will trigger a rerender with the latest context value passed to that MyContext provider. Even if an ancestor uses React.memo or shouldComponentUpdate, a rerender will still happen starting at the component itself using useContext. Don’t forget that the argument to useContext must be the context object itself:  
Correct: useContext(MyContext)
 
Incorrect: useContext(MyContext.Consumer)
 
Incorrect: useContext(MyContext.Provider)
  A component calling useContext will always re-render when the context value changes. If re-rendering the component is expensive, you can optimize it by using memoization.  Tip If you’re familiar with the context API before Hooks, useContext(MyContext) is equivalent to static contextType = MyContext in a class, or to <MyContext.Consumer>. useContext(MyContext) only lets you read the context and subscribe to its changes. You still need a <MyContext.Provider> above in the tree to provide the value for this context.  Putting it together with Context.Provider const themes = {
  light: {
    foreground: "#000000",
    background: "#eeeeee"
  },
  dark: {
    foreground: "#ffffff",
    background: "#222222"
  }
};
const ThemeContext = React.createContext(themes.light);
function App() {
  return (
    <ThemeContext.Provider value={themes.dark}>
      <Toolbar />
    </ThemeContext.Provider>
  );
}
function Toolbar(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <ThemedButton />
    </div>
  );
}
function ThemedButton() {
  const theme = useContext(ThemeContext);
  return (
    <button style={{ background: theme.background, color: theme.foreground }}>
      I am styled by theme context!
    </button>
  );
} This example is modified for hooks from a previous example in the Context Advanced Guide, where you can find more information about when and how to use Context. Additional Hooks  The following Hooks are either variants of the basic ones from the previous section, or only needed for specific edge cases. Don’t stress about learning them up front. 
useReducer  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialArg, init); An alternative to useState. Accepts a reducer of type (state, action) => newState, and returns the current state paired with a dispatch method. (If you’re familiar with Redux, you already know how this works.) useReducer is usually preferable to useState when you have complex state logic that involves multiple sub-values or when the next state depends on the previous one. useReducer also lets you optimize performance for components that trigger deep updates because you can pass dispatch down instead of callbacks. Here’s the counter example from the useState section, rewritten to use a reducer: const initialState = {count: 0};
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return {count: state.count + 1};
    case 'decrement':
      return {count: state.count - 1};
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}
function Counter() {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialState);
  return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'decrement'})}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'increment'})}>+</button>
    </>
  );
}  Note React guarantees that dispatch function identity is stable and won’t change on re-renders. This is why it’s safe to omit from the useEffect or useCallback dependency list.  Specifying the initial state  There are two different ways to initialize useReducer state. You may choose either one depending on the use case. The simplest way is to pass the initial state as a second argument:   const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(
    reducer,
    {count: initialCount}
  );  Note React doesn’t use the state = initialState argument convention popularized by Redux. The initial value sometimes needs to depend on props and so is specified from the Hook call instead. If you feel strongly about this, you can call useReducer(reducer, undefined, reducer) to emulate the Redux behavior, but it’s not encouraged.  Lazy initialization  You can also create the initial state lazily. To do this, you can pass an init function as the third argument. The initial state will be set to init(initialArg). It lets you extract the logic for calculating the initial state outside the reducer. This is also handy for resetting the state later in response to an action: function init(initialCount) {
  return {count: initialCount};
}
function reducer(state, action) {
  switch (action.type) {
    case 'increment':
      return {count: state.count + 1};
    case 'decrement':
      return {count: state.count - 1};
    case 'reset':
      return init(action.payload);
    default:
      throw new Error();
  }
}
function Counter({initialCount}) {
  const [state, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialCount, init);
  return (
    <>
      Count: {state.count}
      <button
        onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'reset', payload: initialCount})}>        Reset
      </button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'decrement'})}>-</button>
      <button onClick={() => dispatch({type: 'increment'})}>+</button>
    </>
  );
} Bailing out of a dispatch  If you return the same value from a Reducer Hook as the current state, React will bail out without rendering the children or firing effects. (React uses the Object.is comparison algorithm.) Note that React may still need to render that specific component again before bailing out. That shouldn’t be a concern because React won’t unnecessarily go “deeper” into the tree. If you’re doing expensive calculations while rendering, you can optimize them with useMemo. 
useCallback  const memoizedCallback = useCallback(
  () => {
    doSomething(a, b);
  },
  [a, b],
); Returns a memoized callback. Pass an inline callback and an array of dependencies. useCallback will return a memoized version of the callback that only changes if one of the dependencies has changed. This is useful when passing callbacks to optimized child components that rely on reference equality to prevent unnecessary renders (e.g. shouldComponentUpdate). useCallback(fn, deps) is equivalent to useMemo(() => fn, deps).  Note The array of dependencies is not passed as arguments to the callback. Conceptually, though, that’s what they represent: every value referenced inside the callback should also appear in the dependencies array. In the future, a sufficiently advanced compiler could create this array automatically. We recommend using the exhaustive-deps rule as part of our eslint-plugin-react-hooks package. It warns when dependencies are specified incorrectly and suggests a fix.  
useMemo  const memoizedValue = useMemo(() => computeExpensiveValue(a, b), [a, b]); Returns a memoized value. Pass a “create” function and an array of dependencies. useMemo will only recompute the memoized value when one of the dependencies has changed. This optimization helps to avoid expensive calculations on every render. Remember that the function passed to useMemo runs during rendering. Don’t do anything there that you wouldn’t normally do while rendering. For example, side effects belong in useEffect, not useMemo. If no array is provided, a new value will be computed on every render. You may rely on useMemo as a performance optimization, not as a semantic guarantee. In the future, React may choose to “forget” some previously memoized values and recalculate them on next render, e.g. to free memory for offscreen components. Write your code so that it still works without useMemo — and then add it to optimize performance.  Note The array of dependencies is not passed as arguments to the function. Conceptually, though, that’s what they represent: every value referenced inside the function should also appear in the dependencies array. In the future, a sufficiently advanced compiler could create this array automatically. We recommend using the exhaustive-deps rule as part of our eslint-plugin-react-hooks package. It warns when dependencies are specified incorrectly and suggests a fix.  
useRef  const refContainer = useRef(initialValue); useRef returns a mutable ref object whose .current property is initialized to the passed argument (initialValue). The returned object will persist for the full lifetime of the component. A common use case is to access a child imperatively: function TextInputWithFocusButton() {
  const inputEl = useRef(null);
  const onButtonClick = () => {
    // `current` points to the mounted text input element
    inputEl.current.focus();
  };
  return (
    <>
      <input ref={inputEl} type="text" />
      <button onClick={onButtonClick}>Focus the input</button>
    </>
  );
} Essentially, useRef is like a “box” that can hold a mutable value in its .current property. You might be familiar with refs primarily as a way to access the DOM. If you pass a ref object to React with <div ref={myRef} />, React will set its .current property to the corresponding DOM node whenever that node changes. However, useRef() is useful for more than the ref attribute. It’s handy for keeping any mutable value around similar to how you’d use instance fields in classes. This works because useRef() creates a plain JavaScript object. The only difference between useRef() and creating a {current: ...} object yourself is that useRef will give you the same ref object on every render. Keep in mind that useRef doesn’t notify you when its content changes. Mutating the .current property doesn’t cause a re-render. If you want to run some code when React attaches or detaches a ref to a DOM node, you may want to use a callback ref instead. 
useImperativeHandle  useImperativeHandle(ref, createHandle, [deps]) useImperativeHandle customizes the instance value that is exposed to parent components when using ref. As always, imperative code using refs should be avoided in most cases. useImperativeHandle should be used with forwardRef: function FancyInput(props, ref) {
  const inputRef = useRef();
  useImperativeHandle(ref, () => ({
    focus: () => {
      inputRef.current.focus();
    }
  }));
  return <input ref={inputRef} ... />;
}
FancyInput = forwardRef(FancyInput); In this example, a parent component that renders <FancyInput ref={inputRef} /> would be able to call inputRef.current.focus(). 
useLayoutEffect  The signature is identical to useEffect, but it fires synchronously after all DOM mutations. Use this to read layout from the DOM and synchronously re-render. Updates scheduled inside useLayoutEffect will be flushed synchronously, before the browser has a chance to paint. Prefer the standard useEffect when possible to avoid blocking visual updates.  Tip If you’re migrating code from a class component, note useLayoutEffect fires in the same phase as componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate. However, we recommend starting with useEffect first and only trying useLayoutEffect if that causes a problem. If you use server rendering, keep in mind that neither useLayoutEffect nor useEffect can run until the JavaScript is downloaded. This is why React warns when a server-rendered component contains useLayoutEffect. To fix this, either move that logic to useEffect (if it isn’t necessary for the first render), or delay showing that component until after the client renders (if the HTML looks broken until useLayoutEffect runs). To exclude a component that needs layout effects from the server-rendered HTML, render it conditionally with showChild && <Child /> and defer showing it with useEffect(() => { setShowChild(true); }, []). This way, the UI doesn’t appear broken before hydration.  
useDebugValue  useDebugValue(value) useDebugValue can be used to display a label for custom hooks in React DevTools. For example, consider the useFriendStatus custom Hook described in “Building Your Own Hooks”: function useFriendStatus(friendID) {
  const [isOnline, setIsOnline] = useState(null);
  // ...
  // Show a label in DevTools next to this Hook
  // e.g. "FriendStatus: Online"
  useDebugValue(isOnline ? 'Online' : 'Offline');
  return isOnline;
}  Tip We don’t recommend adding debug values to every custom Hook. It’s most valuable for custom Hooks that are part of shared libraries.  Defer formatting debug values  In some cases formatting a value for display might be an expensive operation. It’s also unnecessary unless a Hook is actually inspected. For this reason useDebugValue accepts a formatting function as an optional second parameter. This function is only called if the Hooks are inspected. It receives the debug value as a parameter and should return a formatted display value. For example a custom Hook that returned a Date value could avoid calling the toDateString function unnecessarily by passing the following formatter: useDebugValue(date, date => date.toDateString());

hooks-rules
-----------------------------------------------------------
Rules of Hooks
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks are JavaScript functions, but you need to follow two rules when using them. We provide a linter plugin to enforce these rules automatically: Only Call Hooks at the Top Level  Don’t call Hooks inside loops, conditions, or nested functions. Instead, always use Hooks at the top level of your React function, before any early returns. By following this rule, you ensure that Hooks are called in the same order each time a component renders. That’s what allows React to correctly preserve the state of Hooks between multiple useState and useEffect calls. (If you’re curious, we’ll explain this in depth below.) Only Call Hooks from React Functions  Don’t call Hooks from regular JavaScript functions. Instead, you can:  ✅ Call Hooks from React function components. ✅ Call Hooks from custom Hooks (we’ll learn about them on the next page).  By following this rule, you ensure that all stateful logic in a component is clearly visible from its source code. ESLint Plugin  We released an ESLint plugin called eslint-plugin-react-hooks that enforces these two rules. You can add this plugin to your project if you’d like to try it: This plugin is included by default in Create React App. npm install eslint-plugin-react-hooks --save-dev // Your ESLint configuration
{
  "plugins": [
    // ...
    "react-hooks"
  ],
  "rules": {
    // ...
    "react-hooks/rules-of-hooks": "error", // Checks rules of Hooks
    "react-hooks/exhaustive-deps": "warn" // Checks effect dependencies
  }
} You can skip to the next page explaining how to write your own Hooks now. On this page, we’ll continue by explaining the reasoning behind these rules. Explanation  As we learned earlier, we can use multiple State or Effect Hooks in a single component: function Form() {
  // 1. Use the name state variable
  const [name, setName] = useState('Mary');
  // 2. Use an effect for persisting the form
  useEffect(function persistForm() {
    localStorage.setItem('formData', name);
  });
  // 3. Use the surname state variable
  const [surname, setSurname] = useState('Poppins');
  // 4. Use an effect for updating the title
  useEffect(function updateTitle() {
    document.title = name + ' ' + surname;
  });
  // ...
} So how does React know which state corresponds to which useState call? The answer is that React relies on the order in which Hooks are called. Our example works because the order of the Hook calls is the same on every render: // ------------
// First render
// ------------
useState('Mary')           // 1. Initialize the name state variable with 'Mary'
useEffect(persistForm)     // 2. Add an effect for persisting the form
useState('Poppins')        // 3. Initialize the surname state variable with 'Poppins'
useEffect(updateTitle)     // 4. Add an effect for updating the title
// -------------
// Second render
// -------------
useState('Mary')           // 1. Read the name state variable (argument is ignored)
useEffect(persistForm)     // 2. Replace the effect for persisting the form
useState('Poppins')        // 3. Read the surname state variable (argument is ignored)
useEffect(updateTitle)     // 4. Replace the effect for updating the title
// ... As long as the order of the Hook calls is the same between renders, React can associate some local state with each of them. But what happens if we put a Hook call (for example, the persistForm effect) inside a condition?   // 🔴 We're breaking the first rule by using a Hook in a condition
  if (name !== '') {
    useEffect(function persistForm() {
      localStorage.setItem('formData', name);
    });
  } The name !== '' condition is true on the first render, so we run this Hook. However, on the next render the user might clear the form, making the condition false. Now that we skip this Hook during rendering, the order of the Hook calls becomes different: useState('Mary')           // 1. Read the name state variable (argument is ignored)
// useEffect(persistForm)  // 🔴 This Hook was skipped!
useState('Poppins')        // 🔴 2 (but was 3). Fail to read the surname state variable
useEffect(updateTitle)     // 🔴 3 (but was 4). Fail to replace the effect React wouldn’t know what to return for the second useState Hook call. React expected that the second Hook call in this component corresponds to the persistForm effect, just like during the previous render, but it doesn’t anymore. From that point, every next Hook call after the one we skipped would also shift by one, leading to bugs. This is why Hooks must be called on the top level of our components. If we want to run an effect conditionally, we can put that condition inside our Hook:   useEffect(function persistForm() {
    // 👍 We're not breaking the first rule anymore
    if (name !== '') {
      localStorage.setItem('formData', name);
    }
  }); Note that you don’t need to worry about this problem if you use the provided lint rule. But now you also know why Hooks work this way, and which issues the rule is preventing. Next Steps  Finally, we’re ready to learn about writing your own Hooks! Custom Hooks let you combine Hooks provided by React into your own abstractions, and reuse common stateful logic between different components.

hooks-state
-----------------------------------------------------------
Using the State Hook
Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. The introduction page used this example to get familiar with Hooks: import React, { useState } from 'react';
function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  return (
    <div>
      <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
        Click me
      </button>
    </div>
  );
} We’ll start learning about Hooks by comparing this code to an equivalent class example. Equivalent Class Example  If you used classes in React before, this code should look familiar: class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
        <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
} The state starts as { count: 0 }, and we increment state.count when the user clicks a button by calling this.setState(). We’ll use snippets from this class throughout the page.  Note You might be wondering why we’re using a counter here instead of a more realistic example. This is to help us focus on the API while we’re still making our first steps with Hooks.  Hooks and Function Components  As a reminder, function components in React look like this: const Example = (props) => {
  // You can use Hooks here!
  return <div />;
} or this: function Example(props) {
  // You can use Hooks here!
  return <div />;
} You might have previously known these as “stateless components”. We’re now introducing the ability to use React state from these, so we prefer the name “function components”. Hooks don’t work inside classes. But you can use them instead of writing classes. What’s a Hook?  Our new example starts by importing the useState Hook from React: import React, { useState } from 'react';
function Example() {
  // ...
} What is a Hook? A Hook is a special function that lets you “hook into” React features. For example, useState is a Hook that lets you add React state to function components. We’ll learn other Hooks later. When would I use a Hook? If you write a function component and realize you need to add some state to it, previously you had to convert it to a class. Now you can use a Hook inside the existing function component. We’re going to do that right now!  Note: There are some special rules about where you can and can’t use Hooks within a component. We’ll learn them in Rules of Hooks.  Declaring a State Variable  In a class, we initialize the count state to 0 by setting this.state to { count: 0 } in the constructor: class Example extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      count: 0
    };
  } In a function component, we have no this, so we can’t assign or read this.state. Instead, we call the useState Hook directly inside our component: import React, { useState } from 'react';
function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
 What does calling useState do? It declares a “state variable”. Our variable is called count but we could call it anything else, like banana. This is a way to “preserve” some values between the function calls — useState is a new way to use the exact same capabilities that this.state provides in a class. Normally, variables “disappear” when the function exits but state variables are preserved by React. What do we pass to useState as an argument? The only argument to the useState() Hook is the initial state. Unlike with classes, the state doesn’t have to be an object. We can keep a number or a string if that’s all we need. In our example, we just want a number for how many times the user clicked, so pass 0 as initial state for our variable. (If we wanted to store two different values in state, we would call useState() twice.) What does useState return? It returns a pair of values: the current state and a function that updates it. This is why we write const [count, setCount] = useState(). This is similar to this.state.count and this.setState in a class, except you get them in a pair. If you’re not familiar with the syntax we used, we’ll come back to it at the bottom of this page. Now that we know what the useState Hook does, our example should make more sense: import React, { useState } from 'react';
function Example() {
  // Declare a new state variable, which we'll call "count"
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
 We declare a state variable called count, and set it to 0. React will remember its current value between re-renders, and provide the most recent one to our function. If we want to update the current count, we can call setCount.  Note You might be wondering: why is useState not named createState instead? “Create” wouldn’t be quite accurate because the state is only created the first time our component renders. During the next renders, useState gives us the current state. Otherwise it wouldn’t be “state” at all! There’s also a reason why Hook names always start with use. We’ll learn why later in the Rules of Hooks.  Reading State  When we want to display the current count in a class, we read this.state.count:   <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p> In a function, we can use count directly:   <p>You clicked {count} times</p> Updating State  In a class, we need to call this.setState() to update the count state:   <button onClick={() => this.setState({ count: this.state.count + 1 })}>
    Click me
  </button> In a function, we already have setCount and count as variables so we don’t need this:   <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
    Click me
  </button> Recap  Let’s now recap what we learned line by line and check our understanding.  1:  import React, { useState } from 'react';
 2:
 3:  function Example() {
 4:    const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
 5:
 6:    return (
 7:      <div>
 8:        <p>You clicked {count} times</p>
 9:        <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>
10:         Click me
11:        </button>
12:      </div>
13:    );
14:  }  
Line 1: We import the useState Hook from React. It lets us keep local state in a function component. 
Line 4: Inside the Example component, we declare a new state variable by calling the useState Hook. It returns a pair of values, to which we give names. We’re calling our variable count because it holds the number of button clicks. We initialize it to zero by passing 0 as the only useState argument. The second returned item is itself a function. It lets us update the count so we’ll name it setCount. 
Line 9: When the user clicks, we call setCount with a new value. React will then re-render the Example component, passing the new count value to it.  This might seem like a lot to take in at first. Don’t rush it! If you’re lost in the explanation, look at the code above again and try to read it from top to bottom. We promise that once you try to “forget” how state works in classes, and look at this code with fresh eyes, it will make sense. Tip: What Do Square Brackets Mean?  You might have noticed the square brackets when we declare a state variable:   const [count, setCount] = useState(0); The names on the left aren’t a part of the React API. You can name your own state variables:   const [fruit, setFruit] = useState('banana'); This JavaScript syntax is called “array destructuring”. It means that we’re making two new variables fruit and setFruit, where fruit is set to the first value returned by useState, and setFruit is the second. It is equivalent to this code:   var fruitStateVariable = useState('banana'); // Returns a pair
  var fruit = fruitStateVariable[0]; // First item in a pair
  var setFruit = fruitStateVariable[1]; // Second item in a pair When we declare a state variable with useState, it returns a pair — an array with two items. The first item is the current value, and the second is a function that lets us update it. Using [0] and [1] to access them is a bit confusing because they have a specific meaning. This is why we use array destructuring instead.  Note You might be curious how React knows which component useState corresponds to since we’re not passing anything like this back to React. We’ll answer this question and many others in the FAQ section.  Tip: Using Multiple State Variables  Declaring state variables as a pair of [something, setSomething] is also handy because it lets us give different names to different state variables if we want to use more than one: function ExampleWithManyStates() {
  // Declare multiple state variables!
  const [age, setAge] = useState(42);
  const [fruit, setFruit] = useState('banana');
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([{ text: 'Learn Hooks' }]); In the above component, we have age, fruit, and todos as local variables, and we can update them individually:   function handleOrangeClick() {
    // Similar to this.setState({ fruit: 'orange' })
    setFruit('orange');
  } You don’t have to use many state variables. State variables can hold objects and arrays just fine, so you can still group related data together. However, unlike this.setState in a class, updating a state variable always replaces it instead of merging it. We provide more recommendations on splitting independent state variables in the FAQ. Next Steps  On this page we’ve learned about one of the Hooks provided by React, called useState. We’re also sometimes going to refer to it as the “State Hook”. It lets us add local state to React function components — which we did for the first time ever! We also learned a little bit more about what Hooks are. Hooks are functions that let you “hook into” React features from function components. Their names always start with use, and there are more Hooks we haven’t seen yet. Now let’s continue by learning the next Hook: useEffect. It lets you perform side effects in components, and is similar to lifecycle methods in classes.

integrating-with-other-libraries
-----------------------------------------------------------
Integrating with Other Libraries
React can be used in any web application. It can be embedded in other applications and, with a little care, other applications can be embedded in React. This guide will examine some of the more common use cases, focusing on integration with jQuery and Backbone, but the same ideas can be applied to integrating components with any existing code. Integrating with DOM Manipulation Plugins  React is unaware of changes made to the DOM outside of React. It determines updates based on its own internal representation, and if the same DOM nodes are manipulated by another library, React gets confused and has no way to recover. This does not mean it is impossible or even necessarily difficult to combine React with other ways of affecting the DOM, you just have to be mindful of what each is doing. The easiest way to avoid conflicts is to prevent the React component from updating. You can do this by rendering elements that React has no reason to update, like an empty <div />. How to Approach the Problem  To demonstrate this, let’s sketch out a wrapper for a generic jQuery plugin. We will attach a ref to the root DOM element. Inside componentDidMount, we will get a reference to it so we can pass it to the jQuery plugin. To prevent React from touching the DOM after mounting, we will return an empty <div /> from the render() method. The <div /> element has no properties or children, so React has no reason to update it, leaving the jQuery plugin free to manage that part of the DOM: class SomePlugin extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.$el = $(this.el);
    this.$el.somePlugin();
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.$el.somePlugin('destroy');
  }
  render() {
    return <div ref={el => this.el = el} />;
  }
} Note that we defined both componentDidMount and componentWillUnmount lifecycle methods. Many jQuery plugins attach event listeners to the DOM so it’s important to detach them in componentWillUnmount. If the plugin does not provide a method for cleanup, you will probably have to provide your own, remembering to remove any event listeners the plugin registered to prevent memory leaks. Integrating with jQuery Chosen Plugin  For a more concrete example of these concepts, let’s write a minimal wrapper for the plugin Chosen, which augments <select> inputs.  Note: Just because it’s possible, doesn’t mean that it’s the best approach for React apps. We encourage you to use React components when you can. React components are easier to reuse in React applications, and often provide more control over their behavior and appearance.  First, let’s look at what Chosen does to the DOM. If you call it on a <select> DOM node, it reads the attributes off of the original DOM node, hides it with an inline style, and then appends a separate DOM node with its own visual representation right after the <select>. Then it fires jQuery events to notify us about the changes. Let’s say that this is the API we’re striving for with our <Chosen> wrapper React component: function Example() {
  return (
    <Chosen onChange={value => console.log(value)}>
      <option>vanilla</option>
      <option>chocolate</option>
      <option>strawberry</option>
    </Chosen>
  );
} We will implement it as an uncontrolled component for simplicity. First, we will create an empty component with a render() method where we return <select> wrapped in a <div>: class Chosen extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <select className="Chosen-select" ref={el => this.el = el}>
          {this.props.children}
        </select>
      </div>
    );
  }
} Notice how we wrapped <select> in an extra <div>. This is necessary because Chosen will append another DOM element right after the <select> node we passed to it. However, as far as React is concerned, <div> always only has a single child. This is how we ensure that React updates won’t conflict with the extra DOM node appended by Chosen. It is important that if you modify the DOM outside of React flow, you must ensure React doesn’t have a reason to touch those DOM nodes. Next, we will implement the lifecycle methods. We need to initialize Chosen with the ref to the <select> node in componentDidMount, and tear it down in componentWillUnmount: componentDidMount() {
  this.$el = $(this.el);
  this.$el.chosen();
}
componentWillUnmount() {
  this.$el.chosen('destroy');
} Try it on CodePen Note that React assigns no special meaning to the this.el field. It only works because we have previously assigned this field from a ref in the render() method: <select className="Chosen-select" ref={el => this.el = el}> This is enough to get our component to render, but we also want to be notified about the value changes. To do this, we will subscribe to the jQuery change event on the <select> managed by Chosen. We won’t pass this.props.onChange directly to Chosen because component’s props might change over time, and that includes event handlers. Instead, we will declare a handleChange() method that calls this.props.onChange, and subscribe it to the jQuery change event: componentDidMount() {
  this.$el = $(this.el);
  this.$el.chosen();
  this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  this.$el.on('change', this.handleChange);
}
componentWillUnmount() {
  this.$el.off('change', this.handleChange);
  this.$el.chosen('destroy');
}
handleChange(e) {
  this.props.onChange(e.target.value);
}
 Try it on CodePen Finally, there is one more thing left to do. In React, props can change over time. For example, the <Chosen> component can get different children if parent component’s state changes. This means that at integration points it is important that we manually update the DOM in response to prop updates, since we no longer let React manage the DOM for us. Chosen’s documentation suggests that we can use jQuery trigger() API to notify it about changes to the original DOM element. We will let React take care of updating this.props.children inside <select>, but we will also add a componentDidUpdate() lifecycle method that notifies Chosen about changes in the children list: componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
  if (prevProps.children !== this.props.children) {
    this.$el.trigger("chosen:updated");
  }
} This way, Chosen will know to update its DOM element when the <select> children managed by React change. The complete implementation of the Chosen component looks like this: class Chosen extends React.Component {
  componentDidMount() {
    this.$el = $(this.el);
    this.$el.chosen();
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.$el.on('change', this.handleChange);
  }
  
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
    if (prevProps.children !== this.props.children) {
      this.$el.trigger("chosen:updated");
    }
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.$el.off('change', this.handleChange);
    this.$el.chosen('destroy');
  }
  
  handleChange(e) {
    this.props.onChange(e.target.value);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <select className="Chosen-select" ref={el => this.el = el}>
          {this.props.children}
        </select>
      </div>
    );
  }
} Try it on CodePen Integrating with Other View Libraries  React can be embedded into other applications thanks to the flexibility of ReactDOM.render(). Although React is commonly used at startup to load a single root React component into the DOM, ReactDOM.render() can also be called multiple times for independent parts of the UI which can be as small as a button, or as large as an app. In fact, this is exactly how React is used at Facebook. This lets us write applications in React piece by piece, and combine them with our existing server-generated templates and other client-side code. Replacing String-Based Rendering with React  A common pattern in older web applications is to describe chunks of the DOM as a string and insert it into the DOM like so: $el.html(htmlString). These points in a codebase are perfect for introducing React. Just rewrite the string based rendering as a React component. So the following jQuery implementation… $('#container').html('<button id="btn">Say Hello</button>');
$('#btn').click(function() {
  alert('Hello!');
}); …could be rewritten using a React component: function Button() {
  return <button id="btn">Say Hello</button>;
}
ReactDOM.render(
  <Button />,
  document.getElementById('container'),
  function() {
    $('#btn').click(function() {
      alert('Hello!');
    });
  }
); From here you could start moving more logic into the component and begin adopting more common React practices. For example, in components it is best not to rely on IDs because the same component can be rendered multiple times. Instead, we will use the React event system and register the click handler directly on the React <button> element: function Button(props) {
  return <button onClick={props.onClick}>Say Hello</button>;
}
function HelloButton() {
  function handleClick() {
    alert('Hello!');
  }
  return <Button onClick={handleClick} />;
}
ReactDOM.render(
  <HelloButton />,
  document.getElementById('container')
); Try it on CodePen You can have as many such isolated components as you like, and use ReactDOM.render() to render them to different DOM containers. Gradually, as you convert more of your app to React, you will be able to combine them into larger components, and move some of the ReactDOM.render() calls up the hierarchy. Embedding React in a Backbone View  Backbone views typically use HTML strings, or string-producing template functions, to create the content for their DOM elements. This process, too, can be replaced with rendering a React component. Below, we will create a Backbone view called ParagraphView. It will override Backbone’s render() function to render a React <Paragraph> component into the DOM element provided by Backbone (this.el). Here, too, we are using ReactDOM.render(): function Paragraph(props) {
  return <p>{props.text}</p>;
}
const ParagraphView = Backbone.View.extend({
  render() {
    const text = this.model.get('text');
    ReactDOM.render(<Paragraph text={text} />, this.el);
    return this;
  },
  remove() {
    ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(this.el);
    Backbone.View.prototype.remove.call(this);
  }
}); Try it on CodePen It is important that we also call ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode() in the remove method so that React unregisters event handlers and other resources associated with the component tree when it is detached. When a component is removed from within a React tree, the cleanup is performed automatically, but because we are removing the entire tree by hand, we must call this method. Integrating with Model Layers  While it is generally recommended to use unidirectional data flow such as React state, Flux, or Redux, React components can use a model layer from other frameworks and libraries. Using Backbone Models in React Components  The simplest way to consume Backbone models and collections from a React component is to listen to the various change events and manually force an update. Components responsible for rendering models would listen to 'change' events, while components responsible for rendering collections would listen for 'add' and 'remove' events. In both cases, call this.forceUpdate() to rerender the component with the new data. In the example below, the List component renders a Backbone collection, using the Item component to render individual items. class Item extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange() {
    this.forceUpdate();
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    this.props.model.on('change', this.handleChange);
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.props.model.off('change', this.handleChange);
  }
  render() {
    return <li>{this.props.model.get('text')}</li>;
  }
}
class List extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange() {
    this.forceUpdate();
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    this.props.collection.on('add', 'remove', this.handleChange);
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    this.props.collection.off('add', 'remove', this.handleChange);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <ul>
        {this.props.collection.map(model => (
          <Item key={model.cid} model={model} />
        ))}
      </ul>
    );
  }
} Try it on CodePen Extracting Data from Backbone Models  The approach above requires your React components to be aware of the Backbone models and collections. If you later plan to migrate to another data management solution, you might want to concentrate the knowledge about Backbone in as few parts of the code as possible. One solution to this is to extract the model’s attributes as plain data whenever it changes, and keep this logic in a single place. The following is a higher-order component that extracts all attributes of a Backbone model into state, passing the data to the wrapped component. This way, only the higher-order component needs to know about Backbone model internals, and most components in the app can stay agnostic of Backbone. In the example below, we will make a copy of the model’s attributes to form the initial state. We subscribe to the change event (and unsubscribe on unmounting), and when it happens, we update the state with the model’s current attributes. Finally, we make sure that if the model prop itself changes, we don’t forget to unsubscribe from the old model, and subscribe to the new one. Note that this example is not meant to be exhaustive with regards to working with Backbone, but it should give you an idea for how to approach this in a generic way: function connectToBackboneModel(WrappedComponent) {
  return class BackboneComponent extends React.Component {
    constructor(props) {
      super(props);
      this.state = Object.assign({}, props.model.attributes);
      this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    }
    componentDidMount() {
      this.props.model.on('change', this.handleChange);
    }
    componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps) {
      this.setState(Object.assign({}, nextProps.model.attributes));
      if (nextProps.model !== this.props.model) {
        this.props.model.off('change', this.handleChange);
        nextProps.model.on('change', this.handleChange);
      }
    }
    componentWillUnmount() {
      this.props.model.off('change', this.handleChange);
    }
    handleChange(model) {
      this.setState(model.changedAttributes());
    }
    render() {
      const propsExceptModel = Object.assign({}, this.props);
      delete propsExceptModel.model;
      return <WrappedComponent {...propsExceptModel} {...this.state} />;
    }
  }
} To demonstrate how to use it, we will connect a NameInput React component to a Backbone model, and update its firstName attribute every time the input changes: function NameInput(props) {
  return (
    <p>
      <input value={props.firstName} onChange={props.handleChange} />
      <br />
      My name is {props.firstName}.
    </p>
  );
}
const BackboneNameInput = connectToBackboneModel(NameInput);
function Example(props) {
  function handleChange(e) {
    props.model.set('firstName', e.target.value);
  }
  return (
    <BackboneNameInput      model={props.model}      handleChange={handleChange}    />
  );
}
const model = new Backbone.Model({ firstName: 'Frodo' });
ReactDOM.render(
  <Example model={model} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
); Try it on CodePen This technique is not limited to Backbone. You can use React with any model library by subscribing to its changes in the lifecycle methods and, optionally, copying the data into the local React state.

introducing-jsx
-----------------------------------------------------------
Introducing JSX
Consider this variable declaration: const element = <h1>Hello, world!</h1>; This funny tag syntax is neither a string nor HTML. It is called JSX, and it is a syntax extension to JavaScript. We recommend using it with React to describe what the UI should look like. JSX may remind you of a template language, but it comes with the full power of JavaScript. JSX produces React “elements”. We will explore rendering them to the DOM in the next section. Below, you can find the basics of JSX necessary to get you started. Why JSX?  React embraces the fact that rendering logic is inherently coupled with other UI logic: how events are handled, how the state changes over time, and how the data is prepared for display. Instead of artificially separating technologies by putting markup and logic in separate files, React separates concerns with loosely coupled units called “components” that contain both. We will come back to components in a further section, but if you’re not yet comfortable putting markup in JS, this talk might convince you otherwise. React doesn’t require using JSX, but most people find it helpful as a visual aid when working with UI inside the JavaScript code. It also allows React to show more useful error and warning messages. With that out of the way, let’s get started! Embedding Expressions in JSX  In the example below, we declare a variable called name and then use it inside JSX by wrapping it in curly braces: const name = 'Josh Perez';
const element = <h1>Hello, {name}</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
); You can put any valid JavaScript expression inside the curly braces in JSX. For example, 2 + 2, user.firstName, or formatName(user) are all valid JavaScript expressions. In the example below, we embed the result of calling a JavaScript function, formatName(user), into an <h1> element. function formatName(user) {
  return user.firstName + ' ' + user.lastName;
}
const user = {
  firstName: 'Harper',
  lastName: 'Perez'
};
const element = (
  <h1>
    Hello, {formatName(user)}!
  </h1>
);
ReactDOM.render(
  element,
  document.getElementById('root')
); Try it on CodePen We split JSX over multiple lines for readability. While it isn’t required, when doing this, we also recommend wrapping it in parentheses to avoid the pitfalls of automatic semicolon insertion. JSX is an Expression Too  After compilation, JSX expressions become regular JavaScript function calls and evaluate to JavaScript objects. This means that you can use JSX inside of if statements and for loops, assign it to variables, accept it as arguments, and return it from functions: function getGreeting(user) {
  if (user) {
    return <h1>Hello, {formatName(user)}!</h1>;
  }
  return <h1>Hello, Stranger.</h1>;
} Specifying Attributes with JSX  You may use quotes to specify string literals as attributes: const element = <a href="https://www.reactjs.org"> link </a>; You may also use curly braces to embed a JavaScript expression in an attribute: const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl}></img>; Don’t put quotes around curly braces when embedding a JavaScript expression in an attribute. You should either use quotes (for string values) or curly braces (for expressions), but not both in the same attribute.  Warning: Since JSX is closer to JavaScript than to HTML, React DOM uses camelCase property naming convention instead of HTML attribute names. For example, class becomes className in JSX, and tabindex becomes tabIndex.  Specifying Children with JSX  If a tag is empty, you may close it immediately with />, like XML: const element = <img src={user.avatarUrl} />; JSX tags may contain children: const element = (
  <div>
    <h1>Hello!</h1>
    <h2>Good to see you here.</h2>
  </div>
); JSX Prevents Injection Attacks  It is safe to embed user input in JSX: const title = response.potentiallyMaliciousInput;
// This is safe:
const element = <h1>{title}</h1>; By default, React DOM escapes any values embedded in JSX before rendering them. Thus it ensures that you can never inject anything that’s not explicitly written in your application. Everything is converted to a string before being rendered. This helps prevent XSS (cross-site-scripting) attacks. JSX Represents Objects  Babel compiles JSX down to React.createElement() calls. These two examples are identical: const element = (
  <h1 className="greeting">
    Hello, world!
  </h1>
); const element = React.createElement(
  'h1',
  {className: 'greeting'},
  'Hello, world!'
); React.createElement() performs a few checks to help you write bug-free code but essentially it creates an object like this: // Note: this structure is simplified
const element = {
  type: 'h1',
  props: {
    className: 'greeting',
    children: 'Hello, world!'
  }
}; These objects are called “React elements”. You can think of them as descriptions of what you want to see on the screen. React reads these objects and uses them to construct the DOM and keep it up to date. We will explore rendering React elements to the DOM in the next section.  Tip: We recommend using the “Babel” language definition for your editor of choice so that both ES6 and JSX code is properly highlighted.

javascript-environment-requirements
-----------------------------------------------------------
JavaScript Environment Requirements
React 16 depends on the collection types Map and Set. If you support older browsers and devices which may not yet provide these natively (e.g. IE < 11) or which have non-compliant implementations (e.g. IE 11), consider including a global polyfill in your bundled application, such as core-js. A polyfilled environment for React 16 using core-js to support older browsers might look like: import 'core-js/es/map';
import 'core-js/es/set';
import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
ReactDOM.render(
  <h1>Hello, world!</h1>,
  document.getElementById('root')
); React also depends on requestAnimationFrame (even in test environments). You can use the raf package to shim requestAnimationFrame: import 'raf/polyfill';

jsx-in-depth
-----------------------------------------------------------
JSX In Depth
Fundamentally, JSX just provides syntactic sugar for the React.createElement(component, props, ...children) function. The JSX code: <MyButton color="blue" shadowSize={2}>
  Click Me
</MyButton> compiles into: React.createElement(
  MyButton,
  {color: 'blue', shadowSize: 2},
  'Click Me'
) You can also use the self-closing form of the tag if there are no children. So: <div className="sidebar" /> compiles into: React.createElement(
  'div',
  {className: 'sidebar'}
) If you want to test out how some specific JSX is converted into JavaScript, you can try out the online Babel compiler. Specifying The React Element Type  The first part of a JSX tag determines the type of the React element. Capitalized types indicate that the JSX tag is referring to a React component. These tags get compiled into a direct reference to the named variable, so if you use the JSX <Foo /> expression, Foo must be in scope. React Must Be in Scope  Since JSX compiles into calls to React.createElement, the React library must also always be in scope from your JSX code. For example, both of the imports are necessary in this code, even though React and CustomButton are not directly referenced from JavaScript: import React from 'react';
import CustomButton from './CustomButton';
function WarningButton() {
  // return React.createElement(CustomButton, {color: 'red'}, null);
  return <CustomButton color="red" />;
} If you don’t use a JavaScript bundler and loaded React from a <script> tag, it is already in scope as the React global. Using Dot Notation for JSX Type  You can also refer to a React component using dot-notation from within JSX. This is convenient if you have a single module that exports many React components. For example, if MyComponents.DatePicker is a component, you can use it directly from JSX with: import React from 'react';
const MyComponents = {
  DatePicker: function DatePicker(props) {
    return <div>Imagine a {props.color} datepicker here.</div>;
  }
}
function BlueDatePicker() {
  return <MyComponents.DatePicker color="blue" />;
} User-Defined Components Must Be Capitalized  When an element type starts with a lowercase letter, it refers to a built-in component like <div> or <span> and results in a string 'div' or 'span' passed to React.createElement. Types that start with a capital letter like <Foo /> compile to React.createElement(Foo) and correspond to a component defined or imported in your JavaScript file. We recommend naming components with a capital letter. If you do have a component that starts with a lowercase letter, assign it to a capitalized variable before using it in JSX. For example, this code will not run as expected: import React from 'react';
// Wrong! This is a component and should have been capitalized:
function hello(props) {
  // Correct! This use of <div> is legitimate because div is a valid HTML tag:
  return <div>Hello {props.toWhat}</div>;
}
function HelloWorld() {
  // Wrong! React thinks <hello /> is an HTML tag because it's not capitalized:
  return <hello toWhat="World" />;
} To fix this, we will rename hello to Hello and use <Hello /> when referring to it: import React from 'react';
// Correct! This is a component and should be capitalized:
function Hello(props) {
  // Correct! This use of <div> is legitimate because div is a valid HTML tag:
  return <div>Hello {props.toWhat}</div>;
}
function HelloWorld() {
  // Correct! React knows <Hello /> is a component because it's capitalized.
  return <Hello toWhat="World" />;
} Choosing the Type at Runtime  You cannot use a general expression as the React element type. If you do want to use a general expression to indicate the type of the element, just assign it to a capitalized variable first. This often comes up when you want to render a different component based on a prop: import React from 'react';
import { PhotoStory, VideoStory } from './stories';
const components = {
  photo: PhotoStory,
  video: VideoStory
};
function Story(props) {
  // Wrong! JSX type can't be an expression.
  return <components[props.storyType] story={props.story} />;
} To fix this, we will assign the type to a capitalized variable first: import React from 'react';
import { PhotoStory, VideoStory } from './stories';
const components = {
  photo: PhotoStory,
  video: VideoStory
};
function Story(props) {
  // Correct! JSX type can be a capitalized variable.
  const SpecificStory = components[props.storyType];
  return <SpecificStory story={props.story} />;
} Props in JSX  There are several different ways to specify props in JSX. JavaScript Expressions as Props  You can pass any JavaScript expression as a prop, by surrounding it with {}. For example, in this JSX: <MyComponent foo={1 + 2 + 3 + 4} /> For MyComponent, the value of props.foo will be 10 because the expression 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 gets evaluated. if statements and for loops are not expressions in JavaScript, so they can’t be used in JSX directly. Instead, you can put these in the surrounding code. For example: function NumberDescriber(props) {
  let description;
  if (props.number % 2 == 0) {
    description = <strong>even</strong>;
  } else {
    description = <i>odd</i>;
  }
  return <div>{props.number} is an {description} number</div>;
} You can learn more about conditional rendering and loops in the corresponding sections. String Literals  You can pass a string literal as a prop. These two JSX expressions are equivalent: <MyComponent message="hello world" />
<MyComponent message={'hello world'} /> When you pass a string literal, its value is HTML-unescaped. So these two JSX expressions are equivalent: <MyComponent message="&lt;3" />
<MyComponent message={'<3'} /> This behavior is usually not relevant. It’s only mentioned here for completeness. Props Default to “True”  If you pass no value for a prop, it defaults to true. These two JSX expressions are equivalent: <MyTextBox autocomplete />
<MyTextBox autocomplete={true} /> In general, we don’t recommend not passing a value for a prop, because it can be confused with the ES6 object shorthand {foo} which is short for {foo: foo} rather than {foo: true}. This behavior is just there so that it matches the behavior of HTML. Spread Attributes  If you already have props as an object, and you want to pass it in JSX, you can use ... as a “spread” syntax to pass the whole props object. These two components are equivalent: function App1() {
  return <Greeting firstName="Ben" lastName="Hector" />;
}
function App2() {
  const props = {firstName: 'Ben', lastName: 'Hector'};
  return <Greeting {...props} />;
} You can also pick specific props that your component will consume while passing all other props using the spread syntax. const Button = props => {
  const { kind, ...other } = props;
  const className = kind === "primary" ? "PrimaryButton" : "SecondaryButton";
  return <button className={className} {...other} />;
};
const App = () => {
  return (
    <div>
      <Button kind="primary" onClick={() => console.log("clicked!")}>
        Hello World!
      </Button>
    </div>
  );
}; In the example above, the kind prop is safely consumed and is not passed on to the <button> element in the DOM. All other props are passed via the ...other object making this component really flexible. You can see that it passes an onClick and children props. Spread attributes can be useful but they also make it easy to pass unnecessary props to components that don’t care about them or to pass invalid HTML attributes to the DOM. We recommend using this syntax sparingly.  Children in JSX  In JSX expressions that contain both an opening tag and a closing tag, the content between those tags is passed as a special prop: props.children. There are several different ways to pass children: String Literals  You can put a string between the opening and closing tags and props.children will just be that string. This is useful for many of the built-in HTML elements. For example: <MyComponent>Hello world!</MyComponent> This is valid JSX, and props.children in MyComponent will simply be the string "Hello world!". HTML is unescaped, so you can generally write JSX just like you would write HTML in this way: <div>This is valid HTML &amp; JSX at the same time.</div> JSX removes whitespace at the beginning and ending of a line. It also removes blank lines. New lines adjacent to tags are removed; new lines that occur in the middle of string literals are condensed into a single space. So these all render to the same thing: <div>Hello World</div>
<div>
  Hello World
</div>
<div>
  Hello
  World
</div>
<div>
  Hello World
</div> JSX Children  You can provide more JSX elements as the children. This is useful for displaying nested components: <MyContainer>
  <MyFirstComponent />
  <MySecondComponent />
</MyContainer> You can mix together different types of children, so you can use string literals together with JSX children. This is another way in which JSX is like HTML, so that this is both valid JSX and valid HTML: <div>
  Here is a list:
  <ul>
    <li>Item 1</li>
    <li>Item 2</li>
  </ul>
</div> A React component can also return an array of elements: render() {
  // No need to wrap list items in an extra element!
  return [
    // Don't forget the keys :)
    <li key="A">First item</li>,
    <li key="B">Second item</li>,
    <li key="C">Third item</li>,
  ];
} JavaScript Expressions as Children  You can pass any JavaScript expression as children, by enclosing it within {}. For example, these expressions are equivalent: <MyComponent>foo</MyComponent>
<MyComponent>{'foo'}</MyComponent> This is often useful for rendering a list of JSX expressions of arbitrary length. For example, this renders an HTML list: function Item(props) {
  return <li>{props.message}</li>;
}
function TodoList() {
  const todos = ['finish doc', 'submit pr', 'nag dan to review'];
  return (
    <ul>
      {todos.map((message) => <Item key={message} message={message} />)}
    </ul>
  );
} JavaScript expressions can be mixed with other types of children. This is often useful in lieu of string templates: function Hello(props) {
  return <div>Hello {props.addressee}!</div>;
} Functions as Children  Normally, JavaScript expressions inserted in JSX will evaluate to a string, a React element, or a list of those things. However, props.children works just like any other prop in that it can pass any sort of data, not just the sorts that React knows how to render. For example, if you have a custom component, you could have it take a callback as props.children: // Calls the children callback numTimes to produce a repeated component
function Repeat(props) {
  let items = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < props.numTimes; i++) {
    items.push(props.children(i));
  }
  return <div>{items}</div>;
}
function ListOfTenThings() {
  return (
    <Repeat numTimes={10}>
      {(index) => <div key={index}>This is item {index} in the list</div>}
    </Repeat>
  );
} Children passed to a custom component can be anything, as long as that component transforms them into something React can understand before rendering. This usage is not common, but it works if you want to stretch what JSX is capable of. Booleans, Null, and Undefined Are Ignored  false, null, undefined, and true are valid children. They simply don’t render. These JSX expressions will all render to the same thing: <div />
<div></div>
<div>{false}</div>
<div>{null}</div>
<div>{undefined}</div>
<div>{true}</div> This can be useful to conditionally render React elements. This JSX renders the <Header /> component only if showHeader is true: <div>
  {showHeader && <Header />}
  <Content />
</div> One caveat is that some “falsy” values, such as the 0 number, are still rendered by React. For example, this code will not behave as you might expect because 0 will be printed when props.messages is an empty array: <div>
  {props.messages.length &&
    <MessageList messages={props.messages} />
  }
</div> To fix this, make sure that the expression before && is always boolean: <div>
  {props.messages.length > 0 &&
    <MessageList messages={props.messages} />
  }
</div> Conversely, if you want a value like false, true, null, or undefined to appear in the output, you have to convert it to a string first: <div>
  My JavaScript variable is {String(myVariable)}.
</div>

legacy-context
-----------------------------------------------------------
Legacy Context
 Note: The legacy context API will be removed in a future major version. Use the new context API introduced with version 16.3. The legacy API will continue working for all 16.x releases.  How To Use Context   This section documents a legacy API. See the new API.  Suppose you have a structure like: class Button extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <button style={{background: this.props.color}}>
        {this.props.children}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
class Message extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.props.text} <Button color={this.props.color}>Delete</Button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
class MessageList extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const color = "purple";
    const children = this.props.messages.map((message) =>
      <Message text={message.text} color={color} />
    );
    return <div>{children}</div>;
  }
} In this example, we manually thread through a color prop in order to style the Button and Message components appropriately. Using context, we can pass this through the tree automatically: import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
class Button extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <button style={{background: this.context.color}}>
        {this.props.children}
      </button>
    );
  }
}
Button.contextTypes = {
  color: PropTypes.string
};
class Message extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        {this.props.text} <Button>Delete</Button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
class MessageList extends React.Component {
  getChildContext() {
    return {color: "purple"};
  }
  render() {
    const children = this.props.messages.map((message) =>
      <Message text={message.text} />
    );
    return <div>{children}</div>;
  }
}
MessageList.childContextTypes = {
  color: PropTypes.string
};
 By adding childContextTypes and getChildContext to MessageList (the context provider), React passes the information down automatically and any component in the subtree (in this case, Button) can access it by defining contextTypes. If contextTypes is not defined, then context will be an empty object.  Note: React.PropTypes has moved into a different package since React v15.5. Please use the prop-types library instead to define contextTypes. We provide a codemod script to automate the conversion.  Parent-Child Coupling   This section documents a legacy API. See the new API.  Context can also let you build an API where parents and children communicate. For example, one library that works this way is React Router V4: import { BrowserRouter as Router, Route, Link } from 'react-router-dom';
const BasicExample = () => (
  <Router>
    <div>
      <ul>
        <li><Link to="/">Home</Link></li>
        <li><Link to="/about">About</Link></li>
        <li><Link to="/topics">Topics</Link></li>
      </ul>
      <hr />
      <Route exact path="/" component={Home} />
      <Route path="/about" component={About} />
      <Route path="/topics" component={Topics} />
    </div>
  </Router>
); By passing down some information from the Router component, each Link and Route can communicate back to the containing Router. Before you build components with an API similar to this, consider if there are cleaner alternatives. For example, you can pass entire React components as props if you’d like to. Referencing Context in Lifecycle Methods   This section documents a legacy API. See the new API.  If contextTypes is defined within a component, the following lifecycle methods will receive an additional parameter, the context object:  constructor(props, context) componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps, nextContext) shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState, nextContext) componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState, nextContext)   Note: As of React 16, componentDidUpdate no longer receives prevContext.  Referencing Context in Function Components   This section documents a legacy API. See the new API.  Function components are also able to reference context if contextTypes is defined as a property of the function. The following code shows a Button component written as a function component. import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
const Button = ({children}, context) =>
  <button style={{background: context.color}}>
    {children}
  </button>;
Button.contextTypes = {color: PropTypes.string}; Updating Context   This section documents a legacy API. See the new API.  Don’t do it. React has an API to update context, but it is fundamentally broken and you should not use it. The getChildContext function will be called when the state or props changes. In order to update data in the context, trigger a local state update with this.setState. This will trigger a new context and changes will be received by the children. import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
class MediaQuery extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {type:'desktop'};
  }
  getChildContext() {
    return {type: this.state.type};
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    const checkMediaQuery = () => {
      const type = window.matchMedia("(min-width: 1025px)").matches ? 'desktop' : 'mobile';
      if (type !== this.state.type) {
        this.setState({type});
      }
    };
    window.addEventListener('resize', checkMediaQuery);
    checkMediaQuery();
  }
  render() {
    return this.props.children;
  }
}
MediaQuery.childContextTypes = {
  type: PropTypes.string
}; The problem is, if a context value provided by component changes, descendants that use that value won’t update if an intermediate parent returns false from shouldComponentUpdate. This is totally out of control of the components using context, so there’s basically no way to reliably update the context. This blog post has a good explanation of why this is a problem and how you might get around it.

legacy-event-pooling
-----------------------------------------------------------
Event Pooling
 Note This page is only relevant for React 16 and earlier, and for React Native. React 17 on the web does not use event pooling. Read more about this change in React 17.  The SyntheticEvent objects are pooled. This means that the SyntheticEvent object will be reused and all properties will be nullified after the event handler has been called. For example, this won’t work: function handleChange(e) {
  // This won't work because the event object gets reused.
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(e.target.value); // Too late!
  }, 100);
} If you need to access event object’s properties after the event handler has run, you need to call e.persist(): function handleChange(e) {
  // Prevents React from resetting its properties:
  e.persist();
  setTimeout(() => {
    console.log(e.target.value); // Works
  }, 100);
}

lifting-state-up
-----------------------------------------------------------
Lifting State Up
Often, several components need to reflect the same changing data. We recommend lifting the shared state up to their closest common ancestor. Let’s see how this works in action. In this section, we will create a temperature calculator that calculates whether the water would boil at a given temperature. We will start with a component called BoilingVerdict. It accepts the celsius temperature as a prop, and prints whether it is enough to boil the water: function BoilingVerdict(props) {
  if (props.celsius >= 100) {
    return <p>The water would boil.</p>;
  }
  return <p>The water would not boil.</p>;
} Next, we will create a component called Calculator. It renders an <input> that lets you enter the temperature, and keeps its value in this.state.temperature. Additionally, it renders the BoilingVerdict for the current input value. class Calculator extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.state = {temperature: ''};
  }
  handleChange(e) {
    this.setState({temperature: e.target.value});
  }
  render() {
    const temperature = this.state.temperature;
    return (
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Enter temperature in Celsius:</legend>
        <input          value={temperature}          onChange={this.handleChange} />
        <BoilingVerdict          celsius={parseFloat(temperature)} />
      </fieldset>
    );
  }
} Try it on CodePen Adding a Second Input  Our new requirement is that, in addition to a Celsius input, we provide a Fahrenheit input, and they are kept in sync. We can start by extracting a TemperatureInput component from Calculator. We will add a new scale prop to it that can either be "c" or "f": const scaleNames = {
  c: 'Celsius',
  f: 'Fahrenheit'
};
class TemperatureInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.state = {temperature: ''};
  }
  handleChange(e) {
    this.setState({temperature: e.target.value});
  }
  render() {
    const temperature = this.state.temperature;
    const scale = this.props.scale;
    return (
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Enter temperature in {scaleNames[scale]}:</legend>
        <input value={temperature}
               onChange={this.handleChange} />
      </fieldset>
    );
  }
} We can now change the Calculator to render two separate temperature inputs: class Calculator extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <TemperatureInput scale="c" />
        <TemperatureInput scale="f" />
      </div>
    );
  }
} Try it on CodePen We have two inputs now, but when you enter the temperature in one of them, the other doesn’t update. This contradicts our requirement: we want to keep them in sync. We also can’t display the BoilingVerdict from Calculator. The Calculator doesn’t know the current temperature because it is hidden inside the TemperatureInput. Writing Conversion Functions  First, we will write two functions to convert from Celsius to Fahrenheit and back: function toCelsius(fahrenheit) {
  return (fahrenheit - 32) * 5 / 9;
}
function toFahrenheit(celsius) {
  return (celsius * 9 / 5) + 32;
} These two functions convert numbers. We will write another function that takes a string temperature and a converter function as arguments and returns a string. We will use it to calculate the value of one input based on the other input. It returns an empty string on an invalid temperature, and it keeps the output rounded to the third decimal place: function tryConvert(temperature, convert) {
  const input = parseFloat(temperature);
  if (Number.isNaN(input)) {
    return '';
  }
  const output = convert(input);
  const rounded = Math.round(output * 1000) / 1000;
  return rounded.toString();
} For example, tryConvert('abc', toCelsius) returns an empty string, and tryConvert('10.22', toFahrenheit) returns '50.396'. Lifting State Up  Currently, both TemperatureInput components independently keep their values in the local state: class TemperatureInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
    this.state = {temperature: ''};
  }
  handleChange(e) {
    this.setState({temperature: e.target.value});
  }
  render() {
    const temperature = this.state.temperature;
    // ...   However, we want these two inputs to be in sync with each other. When we update the Celsius input, the Fahrenheit input should reflect the converted temperature, and vice versa. In React, sharing state is accomplished by moving it up to the closest common ancestor of the components that need it. This is called “lifting state up”. We will remove the local state from the TemperatureInput and move it into the Calculator instead. If the Calculator owns the shared state, it becomes the “source of truth” for the current temperature in both inputs. It can instruct them both to have values that are consistent with each other. Since the props of both TemperatureInput components are coming from the same parent Calculator component, the two inputs will always be in sync. Let’s see how this works step by step. First, we will replace this.state.temperature with this.props.temperature in the TemperatureInput component. For now, let’s pretend this.props.temperature already exists, although we will need to pass it from the Calculator in the future:   render() {
    // Before: const temperature = this.state.temperature;
    const temperature = this.props.temperature;
    // ... We know that props are read-only. When the temperature was in the local state, the TemperatureInput could just call this.setState() to change it. However, now that the temperature is coming from the parent as a prop, the TemperatureInput has no control over it. In React, this is usually solved by making a component “controlled”. Just like the DOM <input> accepts both a value and an onChange prop, so can the custom TemperatureInput accept both temperature and onTemperatureChange props from its parent Calculator. Now, when the TemperatureInput wants to update its temperature, it calls this.props.onTemperatureChange:   handleChange(e) {
    // Before: this.setState({temperature: e.target.value});
    this.props.onTemperatureChange(e.target.value);
    // ...  Note: There is no special meaning to either temperature or onTemperatureChange prop names in custom components. We could have called them anything else, like name them value and onChange which is a common convention.  The onTemperatureChange prop will be provided together with the temperature prop by the parent Calculator component. It will handle the change by modifying its own local state, thus re-rendering both inputs with the new values. We will look at the new Calculator implementation very soon. Before diving into the changes in the Calculator, let’s recap our changes to the TemperatureInput component. We have removed the local state from it, and instead of reading this.state.temperature, we now read this.props.temperature. Instead of calling this.setState() when we want to make a change, we now call this.props.onTemperatureChange(), which will be provided by the Calculator: class TemperatureInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleChange = this.handleChange.bind(this);
  }
  handleChange(e) {
    this.props.onTemperatureChange(e.target.value);
  }
  render() {
    const temperature = this.props.temperature;
    const scale = this.props.scale;
    return (
      <fieldset>
        <legend>Enter temperature in {scaleNames[scale]}:</legend>
        <input value={temperature}
               onChange={this.handleChange} />
      </fieldset>
    );
  }
} Now let’s turn to the Calculator component. We will store the current input’s temperature and scale in its local state. This is the state we “lifted up” from the inputs, and it will serve as the “source of truth” for both of them. It is the minimal representation of all the data we need to know in order to render both inputs. For example, if we enter 37 into the Celsius input, the state of the Calculator component will be: {
  temperature: '37',
  scale: 'c'
} If we later edit the Fahrenheit field to be 212, the state of the Calculator will be: {
  temperature: '212',
  scale: 'f'
} We could have stored the value of both inputs but it turns out to be unnecessary. It is enough to store the value of the most recently changed input, and the scale that it represents. We can then infer the value of the other input based on the current temperature and scale alone. The inputs stay in sync because their values are computed from the same state: class Calculator extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleCelsiusChange = this.handleCelsiusChange.bind(this);
    this.handleFahrenheitChange = this.handleFahrenheitChange.bind(this);
    this.state = {temperature: '', scale: 'c'};
  }
  handleCelsiusChange(temperature) {
    this.setState({scale: 'c', temperature});
  }
  handleFahrenheitChange(temperature) {
    this.setState({scale: 'f', temperature});
  }
  render() {
    const scale = this.state.scale;
    const temperature = this.state.temperature;
    const celsius = scale === 'f' ? tryConvert(temperature, toCelsius) : temperature;
    const fahrenheit = scale === 'c' ? tryConvert(temperature, toFahrenheit) : temperature;
    return (
      <div>
        <TemperatureInput
          scale="c"
          temperature={celsius}          onTemperatureChange={this.handleCelsiusChange} />        <TemperatureInput
          scale="f"
          temperature={fahrenheit}          onTemperatureChange={this.handleFahrenheitChange} />        <BoilingVerdict
          celsius={parseFloat(celsius)} />      </div>
    );
  }
} Try it on CodePen Now, no matter which input you edit, this.state.temperature and this.state.scale in the Calculator get updated. One of the inputs gets the value as is, so any user input is preserved, and the other input value is always recalculated based on it. Let’s recap what happens when you edit an input:  React calls the function specified as onChange on the DOM <input>. In our case, this is the handleChange method in the TemperatureInput component. The handleChange method in the TemperatureInput component calls this.props.onTemperatureChange() with the new desired value. Its props, including onTemperatureChange, were provided by its parent component, the Calculator. When it previously rendered, the Calculator had specified that onTemperatureChange of the Celsius TemperatureInput is the Calculator’s handleCelsiusChange method, and onTemperatureChange of the Fahrenheit TemperatureInput is the Calculator’s handleFahrenheitChange method. So either of these two Calculator methods gets called depending on which input we edited. Inside these methods, the Calculator component asks React to re-render itself by calling this.setState() with the new input value and the current scale of the input we just edited. React calls the Calculator component’s render method to learn what the UI should look like. The values of both inputs are recomputed based on the current temperature and the active scale. The temperature conversion is performed here. React calls the render methods of the individual TemperatureInput components with their new props specified by the Calculator. It learns what their UI should look like. React calls the render method of the BoilingVerdict component, passing the temperature in Celsius as its props. React DOM updates the DOM with the boiling verdict and to match the desired input values. The input we just edited receives its current value, and the other input is updated to the temperature after conversion.  Every update goes through the same steps so the inputs stay in sync. Lessons Learned  There should be a single “source of truth” for any data that changes in a React application. Usually, the state is first added to the component that needs it for rendering. Then, if other components also need it, you can lift it up to their closest common ancestor. Instead of trying to sync the state between different components, you should rely on the top-down data flow. Lifting state involves writing more “boilerplate” code than two-way binding approaches, but as a benefit, it takes less work to find and isolate bugs. Since any state “lives” in some component and that component alone can change it, the surface area for bugs is greatly reduced. Additionally, you can implement any custom logic to reject or transform user input. If something can be derived from either props or state, it probably shouldn’t be in the state. For example, instead of storing both celsiusValue and fahrenheitValue, we store just the last edited temperature and its scale. The value of the other input can always be calculated from them in the render() method. This lets us clear or apply rounding to the other field without losing any precision in the user input. When you see something wrong in the UI, you can use React Developer Tools to inspect the props and move up the tree until you find the component responsible for updating the state. This lets you trace the bugs to their source: Is this page useful?

lists-and-keys
-----------------------------------------------------------
Lists and Keys
First, let’s review how you transform lists in JavaScript. Given the code below, we use the map() function to take an array of numbers and double their values. We assign the new array returned by map() to the variable doubled and log it: const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const doubled = numbers.map((number) => number * 2);
console.log(doubled); This code logs [2, 4, 6, 8, 10] to the console. In React, transforming arrays into lists of elements is nearly identical. Rendering Multiple Components  You can build collections of elements and include them in JSX using curly braces {}. Below, we loop through the numbers array using the JavaScript map() function. We return a <li> element for each item. Finally, we assign the resulting array of elements to listItems: const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li>{number}</li>
);
 We include the entire listItems array inside a <ul> element, and render it to the DOM: ReactDOM.render(
  <ul>{listItems}</ul>,
  document.getElementById('root')
); Try it on CodePen This code displays a bullet list of numbers between 1 and 5. Basic List Component  Usually you would render lists inside a component. We can refactor the previous example into a component that accepts an array of numbers and outputs a list of elements. function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <li>{number}</li>
  );
  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
ReactDOM.render(
  <NumberList numbers={numbers} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
); When you run this code, you’ll be given a warning that a key should be provided for list items. A “key” is a special string attribute you need to include when creating lists of elements. We’ll discuss why it’s important in the next section. Let’s assign a key to our list items inside numbers.map() and fix the missing key issue. function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <li key={number.toString()}>
      {number}
    </li>
  );
  return (
    <ul>{listItems}</ul>
  );
}
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
ReactDOM.render(
  <NumberList numbers={numbers} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
); Try it on CodePen Keys  Keys help React identify which items have changed, are added, or are removed. Keys should be given to the elements inside the array to give the elements a stable identity: const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
  <li key={number.toString()}>
    {number}
  </li>
); The best way to pick a key is to use a string that uniquely identifies a list item among its siblings. Most often you would use IDs from your data as keys: const todoItems = todos.map((todo) =>
  <li key={todo.id}>
    {todo.text}
  </li>
); When you don’t have stable IDs for rendered items, you may use the item index as a key as a last resort: const todoItems = todos.map((todo, index) =>
  // Only do this if items have no stable IDs
  <li key={index}>
    {todo.text}
  </li>
); We don’t recommend using indexes for keys if the order of items may change. This can negatively impact performance and may cause issues with component state. Check out Robin Pokorny’s article for an in-depth explanation on the negative impacts of using an index as a key. If you choose not to assign an explicit key to list items then React will default to using indexes as keys. Here is an in-depth explanation about why keys are necessary if you’re interested in learning more. Extracting Components with Keys  Keys only make sense in the context of the surrounding array. For example, if you extract a ListItem component, you should keep the key on the <ListItem /> elements in the array rather than on the <li> element in the ListItem itself. Example: Incorrect Key Usage function ListItem(props) {
  const value = props.value;
  return (
    // Wrong! There is no need to specify the key here:
    <li key={value.toString()}>
      {value}
    </li>
  );
}
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    // Wrong! The key should have been specified here:
    <ListItem value={number} />
  );
  return (
    <ul>
      {listItems}
    </ul>
  );
}
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
ReactDOM.render(
  <NumberList numbers={numbers} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
); Example: Correct Key Usage function ListItem(props) {
  // Correct! There is no need to specify the key here:
  return <li>{props.value}</li>;
}
function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    // Correct! Key should be specified inside the array.
    <ListItem key={number.toString()} value={number} />
  );
  return (
    <ul>
      {listItems}
    </ul>
  );
}
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
ReactDOM.render(
  <NumberList numbers={numbers} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
); Try it on CodePen A good rule of thumb is that elements inside the map() call need keys. Keys Must Only Be Unique Among Siblings  Keys used within arrays should be unique among their siblings. However, they don’t need to be globally unique. We can use the same keys when we produce two different arrays: function Blog(props) {
  const sidebar = (
    <ul>
      {props.posts.map((post) =>
        <li key={post.id}>
          {post.title}
        </li>
      )}
    </ul>
  );
  const content = props.posts.map((post) =>
    <div key={post.id}>
      <h3>{post.title}</h3>
      <p>{post.content}</p>
    </div>
  );
  return (
    <div>
      {sidebar}
      <hr />
      {content}
    </div>
  );
}
const posts = [
  {id: 1, title: 'Hello World', content: 'Welcome to learning React!'},
  {id: 2, title: 'Installation', content: 'You can install React from npm.'}
];
ReactDOM.render(
  <Blog posts={posts} />,
  document.getElementById('root')
); Try it on CodePen Keys serve as a hint to React but they don’t get passed to your components. If you need the same value in your component, pass it explicitly as a prop with a different name: const content = posts.map((post) =>
  <Post
    key={post.id}    id={post.id}    title={post.title} />
); With the example above, the Post component can read props.id, but not props.key. Embedding map() in JSX  In the examples above we declared a separate listItems variable and included it in JSX: function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
    <ListItem key={number.toString()}              value={number} />
  );
  return (
    <ul>
      {listItems}
    </ul>
  );
} JSX allows embedding any expression in curly braces so we could inline the map() result: function NumberList(props) {
  const numbers = props.numbers;
  return (
    <ul>
      {numbers.map((number) =>
        <ListItem key={number.toString()}                  value={number} />
      )}
    </ul>
  );
} Try it on CodePen Sometimes this results in clearer code, but this style can also be abused. Like in JavaScript, it is up to you to decide whether it is worth extracting a variable for readability. Keep in mind that if the map() body is too nested, it might be a good time to extract a component.

optimizing-performance
-----------------------------------------------------------
Optimizing Performance
Internally, React uses several clever techniques to minimize the number of costly DOM operations required to update the UI. For many applications, using React will lead to a fast user interface without doing much work to specifically optimize for performance. Nevertheless, there are several ways you can speed up your React application. Use the Production Build  If you’re benchmarking or experiencing performance problems in your React apps, make sure you’re testing with the minified production build. By default, React includes many helpful warnings. These warnings are very useful in development. However, they make React larger and slower so you should make sure to use the production version when you deploy the app. If you aren’t sure whether your build process is set up correctly, you can check it by installing React Developer Tools for Chrome. If you visit a site with React in production mode, the icon will have a dark background:    If you visit a site with React in development mode, the icon will have a red background:    It is expected that you use the development mode when working on your app, and the production mode when deploying your app to the users. You can find instructions for building your app for production below. Create React App  If your project is built with Create React App, run: npm run build This will create a production build of your app in the build/ folder of your project. Remember that this is only necessary before deploying to production. For normal development, use npm start. Single-File Builds  We offer production-ready versions of React and React DOM as single files: <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@17/umd/react.production.min.js"></script>
<script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@17/umd/react-dom.production.min.js"></script> Remember that only React files ending with .production.min.js are suitable for production. Brunch  For the most efficient Brunch production build, install the terser-brunch plugin: # If you use npm
npm install --save-dev terser-brunch
# If you use Yarn
yarn add --dev terser-brunch Then, to create a production build, add the -p flag to the build command: brunch build -p Remember that you only need to do this for production builds. You shouldn’t pass the -p flag or apply this plugin in development, because it will hide useful React warnings and make the builds much slower. Browserify  For the most efficient Browserify production build, install a few plugins: # If you use npm
npm install --save-dev envify terser uglifyify
# If you use Yarn
yarn add --dev envify terser uglifyify To create a production build, make sure that you add these transforms (the order matters):  The envify transform ensures the right build environment is set. Make it global (-g). The uglifyify transform removes development imports. Make it global too (-g). Finally, the resulting bundle is piped to terser for mangling (read why).  For example: browserify ./index.js \
  -g [ envify --NODE_ENV production ] \
  -g uglifyify \
  | terser --compress --mangle > ./bundle.js Remember that you only need to do this for production builds. You shouldn’t apply these plugins in development because they will hide useful React warnings, and make the builds much slower. Rollup  For the most efficient Rollup production build, install a few plugins: # If you use npm
npm install --save-dev rollup-plugin-commonjs rollup-plugin-replace rollup-plugin-terser
# If you use Yarn
yarn add --dev rollup-plugin-commonjs rollup-plugin-replace rollup-plugin-terser To create a production build, make sure that you add these plugins (the order matters):  The replace plugin ensures the right build environment is set. The commonjs plugin provides support for CommonJS in Rollup. The terser plugin compresses and mangles the final bundle.  plugins: [
  // ...
  require('rollup-plugin-replace')({
    'process.env.NODE_ENV': JSON.stringify('production')
  }),
  require('rollup-plugin-commonjs')(),
  require('rollup-plugin-terser')(),
  // ...
] For a complete setup example see this gist. Remember that you only need to do this for production builds. You shouldn’t apply the terser plugin or the replace plugin with 'production' value in development because they will hide useful React warnings, and make the builds much slower. webpack   Note: If you’re using Create React App, please follow the instructions above. This section is only relevant if you configure webpack directly.  Webpack v4+ will minify your code by default in production mode. const TerserPlugin = require('terser-webpack-plugin');
module.exports = {
  mode: 'production',
  optimization: {
    minimizer: [new TerserPlugin({ /* additional options here */ })],
  },
}; You can learn more about this in webpack documentation. Remember that you only need to do this for production builds. You shouldn’t apply TerserPlugin in development because it will hide useful React warnings, and make the builds much slower. Profiling Components with the DevTools Profiler  react-dom 16.5+ and react-native 0.57+ provide enhanced profiling capabilities in DEV mode with the React DevTools Profiler. An overview of the Profiler can be found in the blog post “Introducing the React Profiler”. A video walkthrough of the profiler is also available on YouTube. If you haven’t yet installed the React DevTools, you can find them here:  Chrome Browser Extension Firefox Browser Extension Standalone Node Package   Note A production profiling bundle of react-dom is also available as react-dom/profiling. Read more about how to use this bundle at fb.me/react-profiling   Note Before React 17, we use the standard User Timing API to profile components with the chrome performance tab. For a more detailed walkthrough, check out this article by Ben Schwarz.  Virtualize Long Lists  If your application renders long lists of data (hundreds or thousands of rows), we recommend using a technique known as “windowing”. This technique only renders a small subset of your rows at any given time, and can dramatically reduce the time it takes to re-render the components as well as the number of DOM nodes created. react-window and react-virtualized are popular windowing libraries. They provide several reusable components for displaying lists, grids, and tabular data. You can also create your own windowing component, like Twitter did, if you want something more tailored to your application’s specific use case. Avoid Reconciliation  React builds and maintains an internal representation of the rendered UI. It includes the React elements you return from your components. This representation lets React avoid creating DOM nodes and accessing existing ones beyond necessity, as that can be slower than operations on JavaScript objects. Sometimes it is referred to as a “virtual DOM”, but it works the same way on React Native. When a component’s props or state change, React decides whether an actual DOM update is necessary by comparing the newly returned element with the previously rendered one. When they are not equal, React will update the DOM. Even though React only updates the changed DOM nodes, re-rendering still takes some time. In many cases it’s not a problem, but if the slowdown is noticeable, you can speed all of this up by overriding the lifecycle function shouldComponentUpdate, which is triggered before the re-rendering process starts. The default implementation of this function returns true, leaving React to perform the update: shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
  return true;
} If you know that in some situations your component doesn’t need to update, you can return false from shouldComponentUpdate instead, to skip the whole rendering process, including calling render() on this component and below. In most cases, instead of writing shouldComponentUpdate() by hand, you can inherit from React.PureComponent. It is equivalent to implementing shouldComponentUpdate() with a shallow comparison of current and previous props and state. shouldComponentUpdate In Action  Here’s a subtree of components. For each one, SCU indicates what shouldComponentUpdate returned, and vDOMEq indicates whether the rendered React elements were equivalent. Finally, the circle’s color indicates whether the component had to be reconciled or not.      Since shouldComponentUpdate returned false for the subtree rooted at C2, React did not attempt to render C2, and thus didn’t even have to invoke shouldComponentUpdate on C4 and C5. For C1 and C3, shouldComponentUpdate returned true, so React had to go down to the leaves and check them. For C6 shouldComponentUpdate returned true, and since the rendered elements weren’t equivalent React had to update the DOM. The last interesting case is C8. React had to render this component, but since the React elements it returned were equal to the previously rendered ones, it didn’t have to update the DOM. Note that React only had to do DOM mutations for C6, which was inevitable. For C8, it bailed out by comparing the rendered React elements, and for C2’s subtree and C7, it didn’t even have to compare the elements as we bailed out on shouldComponentUpdate, and render was not called. Examples  If the only way your component ever changes is when the props.color or the state.count variable changes, you could have shouldComponentUpdate check that: class CounterButton extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {count: 1};
  }
  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) {
    if (this.props.color !== nextProps.color) {
      return true;
    }
    if (this.state.count !== nextState.count) {
      return true;
    }
    return false;
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <button
        color={this.props.color}
        onClick={() => this.setState(state => ({count: state.count + 1}))}>
        Count: {this.state.count}
      </button>
    );
  }
} In this code, shouldComponentUpdate is just checking if there is any change in props.color or state.count. If those values don’t change, the component doesn’t update. If your component got more complex, you could use a similar pattern of doing a “shallow comparison” between all the fields of props and state to determine if the component should update. This pattern is common enough that React provides a helper to use this logic - just inherit from React.PureComponent. So this code is a simpler way to achieve the same thing: class CounterButton extends React.PureComponent {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {count: 1};
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <button
        color={this.props.color}
        onClick={() => this.setState(state => ({count: state.count + 1}))}>
        Count: {this.state.count}
      </button>
    );
  }
} Most of the time, you can use React.PureComponent instead of writing your own shouldComponentUpdate. It only does a shallow comparison, so you can’t use it if the props or state may have been mutated in a way that a shallow comparison would miss. This can be a problem with more complex data structures. For example, let’s say you want a ListOfWords component to render a comma-separated list of words, with a parent WordAdder component that lets you click a button to add a word to the list. This code does not work correctly: class ListOfWords extends React.PureComponent {
  render() {
    return <div>{this.props.words.join(',')}</div>;
  }
}
class WordAdder extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      words: ['marklar']
    };
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }
  handleClick() {
    // This section is bad style and causes a bug
    const words = this.state.words;
    words.push('marklar');
    this.setState({words: words});
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick} />
        <ListOfWords words={this.state.words} />
      </div>
    );
  }
} The problem is that PureComponent will do a simple comparison between the old and new values of this.props.words. Since this code mutates the words array in the handleClick method of WordAdder, the old and new values of this.props.words will compare as equal, even though the actual words in the array have changed. The ListOfWords will thus not update even though it has new words that should be rendered. The Power Of Not Mutating Data  The simplest way to avoid this problem is to avoid mutating values that you are using as props or state. For example, the handleClick method above could be rewritten using concat as: handleClick() {
  this.setState(state => ({
    words: state.words.concat(['marklar'])
  }));
} ES6 supports a spread syntax for arrays which can make this easier. If you’re using Create React App, this syntax is available by default. handleClick() {
  this.setState(state => ({
    words: [...state.words, 'marklar'],
  }));
}; You can also rewrite code that mutates objects to avoid mutation, in a similar way. For example, let’s say we have an object named colormap and we want to write a function that changes colormap.right to be 'blue'. We could write: function updateColorMap(colormap) {
  colormap.right = 'blue';
} To write this without mutating the original object, we can use Object.assign method: function updateColorMap(colormap) {
  return Object.assign({}, colormap, {right: 'blue'});
} updateColorMap now returns a new object, rather than mutating the old one. Object.assign is in ES6 and requires a polyfill. Object spread syntax makes it easier to update objects without mutation as well: function updateColorMap(colormap) {
  return {...colormap, right: 'blue'};
} This feature was added to JavaScript in ES2018. If you’re using Create React App, both Object.assign and the object spread syntax are available by default. When you deal with deeply nested objects, updating them in an immutable way can feel convoluted. If you run into this problem, check out Immer or immutability-helper. These libraries let you write highly readable code without losing the benefits of immutability.

portals
-----------------------------------------------------------
Portals
Portals provide a first-class way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the DOM hierarchy of the parent component. ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container) The first argument (child) is any renderable React child, such as an element, string, or fragment. The second argument (container) is a DOM element. Usage  Normally, when you return an element from a component’s render method, it’s mounted into the DOM as a child of the nearest parent node: render() {
  // React mounts a new div and renders the children into it
  return (
    <div>
      {this.props.children}
    </div>
  );
} However, sometimes it’s useful to insert a child into a different location in the DOM: render() {
  // React does *not* create a new div. It renders the children into `domNode`.
  // `domNode` is any valid DOM node, regardless of its location in the DOM.
  return ReactDOM.createPortal(
    this.props.children,
    domNode
  );
} A typical use case for portals is when a parent component has an overflow: hidden or z-index style, but you need the child to visually “break out” of its container. For example, dialogs, hovercards, and tooltips.  Note: When working with portals, remember that managing keyboard focus becomes very important. For modal dialogs, ensure that everyone can interact with them by following the WAI-ARIA Modal Authoring Practices.  Try it on CodePen Event Bubbling Through Portals  Even though a portal can be anywhere in the DOM tree, it behaves like a normal React child in every other way. Features like context work exactly the same regardless of whether the child is a portal, as the portal still exists in the React tree regardless of position in the DOM tree. This includes event bubbling. An event fired from inside a portal will propagate to ancestors in the containing React tree, even if those elements are not ancestors in the DOM tree. Assuming the following HTML structure: <html>
  <body>
    <div id="app-root"></div>
    <div id="modal-root"></div>
  </body>
</html> A Parent component in #app-root would be able to catch an uncaught, bubbling event from the sibling node #modal-root. // These two containers are siblings in the DOM
const appRoot = document.getElementById('app-root');
const modalRoot = document.getElementById('modal-root');
class Modal extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.el = document.createElement('div');
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    // The portal element is inserted in the DOM tree after
    // the Modal's children are mounted, meaning that children
    // will be mounted on a detached DOM node. If a child
    // component requires to be attached to the DOM tree
    // immediately when mounted, for example to measure a
    // DOM node, or uses 'autoFocus' in a descendant, add
    // state to Modal and only render the children when Modal
    // is inserted in the DOM tree.
    modalRoot.appendChild(this.el);
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    modalRoot.removeChild(this.el);
  }
  render() {
    return ReactDOM.createPortal(
      this.props.children,
      this.el
    );
  }
}
class Parent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {clicks: 0};
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }
  handleClick() {
    // This will fire when the button in Child is clicked,
    // updating Parent's state, even though button
    // is not direct descendant in the DOM.
    this.setState(state => ({
      clicks: state.clicks + 1
    }));
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div onClick={this.handleClick}>
        <p>Number of clicks: {this.state.clicks}</p>
        <p>
          Open up the browser DevTools
          to observe that the button
          is not a child of the div
          with the onClick handler.
        </p>
        <Modal>
          <Child />
        </Modal>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
function Child() {
  // The click event on this button will bubble up to parent,
  // because there is no 'onClick' attribute defined
  return (
    <div className="modal">
      <button>Click</button>
    </div>
  );
}
ReactDOM.render(<Parent />, appRoot); Try it on CodePen Catching an event bubbling up from a portal in a parent component allows the development of more flexible abstractions that are not inherently reliant on portals. For example, if you render a <Modal /> component, the parent can capture its events regardless of whether it’s implemented using portals.

profiler
-----------------------------------------------------------
Profiler API
The Profiler measures how often a React application renders and what the “cost” of rendering is. Its purpose is to help identify parts of an application that are slow and may benefit from optimizations such as memoization.  Note: Profiling adds some additional overhead, so it is disabled in the production build. To opt into production profiling, React provides a special production build with profiling enabled. Read more about how to use this build at fb.me/react-profiling  Usage  A Profiler can be added anywhere in a React tree to measure the cost of rendering that part of the tree. It requires two props: an id (string) and an onRender callback (function) which React calls any time a component within the tree “commits” an update. For example, to profile a Navigation component and its descendants: render(
  <App>
    <Profiler id="Navigation" onRender={callback}>
      <Navigation {...props} />
    </Profiler>
    <Main {...props} />
  </App>
); Multiple Profiler components can be used to measure different parts of an application: render(
  <App>
    <Profiler id="Navigation" onRender={callback}>
      <Navigation {...props} />
    </Profiler>
    <Profiler id="Main" onRender={callback}>
      <Main {...props} />
    </Profiler>
  </App>
); Profiler components can also be nested to measure different components within the same subtree: render(
  <App>
    <Profiler id="Panel" onRender={callback}>
      <Panel {...props}>
        <Profiler id="Content" onRender={callback}>
          <Content {...props} />
        </Profiler>
        <Profiler id="PreviewPane" onRender={callback}>
          <PreviewPane {...props} />
        </Profiler>
      </Panel>
    </Profiler>
  </App>
);  Note Although Profiler is a light-weight component, it should be used only when necessary; each use adds some CPU and memory overhead to an application.  
onRender Callback  The Profiler requires an onRender function as a prop. React calls this function any time a component within the profiled tree “commits” an update. It receives parameters describing what was rendered and how long it took. function onRenderCallback(
  id, // the "id" prop of the Profiler tree that has just committed
  phase, // either "mount" (if the tree just mounted) or "update" (if it re-rendered)
  actualDuration, // time spent rendering the committed update
  baseDuration, // estimated time to render the entire subtree without memoization
  startTime, // when React began rendering this update
  commitTime, // when React committed this update
  interactions // the Set of interactions belonging to this update
) {
  // Aggregate or log render timings...
} Let’s take a closer look at each of the props:  
id: string - The id prop of the Profiler tree that has just committed. This can be used to identify which part of the tree was committed if you are using multiple profilers. 
phase: "mount" | "update" - Identifies whether the tree has just been mounted for the first time or re-rendered due to a change in props, state, or hooks. 
actualDuration: number - Time spent rendering the Profiler and its descendants for the current update. This indicates how well the subtree makes use of memoization (e.g. React.memo, useMemo, shouldComponentUpdate). Ideally this value should decrease significantly after the initial mount as many of the descendants will only need to re-render if their specific props change. 
baseDuration: number - Duration of the most recent render time for each individual component within the Profiler tree. This value estimates a worst-case cost of rendering (e.g. the initial mount or a tree with no memoization). 
startTime: number - Timestamp when React began rendering the current update. 
commitTime: number - Timestamp when React committed the current update. This value is shared between all profilers in a commit, enabling them to be grouped if desirable. 
interactions: Set - Set of “interactions” that were being traced when the update was scheduled (e.g. when render or setState were called).   Note Interactions can be used to identify the cause of an update, although the API for tracing them is still experimental. Learn more about it at fb.me/react-interaction-tracing

react-api
-----------------------------------------------------------
React Top-Level API
React is the entry point to the React library. If you load React from a <script> tag, these top-level APIs are available on the React global. If you use ES6 with npm, you can write import React from 'react'. If you use ES5 with npm, you can write var React = require('react'). Overview  Components  React components let you split the UI into independent, reusable pieces, and think about each piece in isolation. React components can be defined by subclassing React.Component or React.PureComponent.  React.Component React.PureComponent  If you don’t use ES6 classes, you may use the create-react-class module instead. See Using React without ES6 for more information. React components can also be defined as functions which can be wrapped:  React.memo  Creating React Elements  We recommend using JSX to describe what your UI should look like. Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling React.createElement(). You will not typically invoke the following methods directly if you are using JSX.  createElement() createFactory()  See Using React without JSX for more information. Transforming Elements  React provides several APIs for manipulating elements:  cloneElement() isValidElement() React.Children  Fragments  React also provides a component for rendering multiple elements without a wrapper.  React.Fragment  Refs   React.createRef React.forwardRef  Suspense  Suspense lets components “wait” for something before rendering. Today, Suspense only supports one use case: loading components dynamically with React.lazy. In the future, it will support other use cases like data fetching.  React.lazy React.Suspense  Hooks  Hooks are a new addition in React 16.8. They let you use state and other React features without writing a class. Hooks have a dedicated docs section and a separate API reference:   Basic Hooks  useState useEffect useContext    Additional Hooks  useReducer useCallback useMemo useRef useImperativeHandle useLayoutEffect useDebugValue    Reference  
React.Component  React.Component is the base class for React components when they are defined using ES6 classes: class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
} See the React.Component API Reference for a list of methods and properties related to the base React.Component class. 
React.PureComponent  React.PureComponent is similar to React.Component. The difference between them is that React.Component doesn’t implement shouldComponentUpdate(), but React.PureComponent implements it with a shallow prop and state comparison. If your React component’s render() function renders the same result given the same props and state, you can use React.PureComponent for a performance boost in some cases.  Note React.PureComponent’s shouldComponentUpdate() only shallowly compares the objects. If these contain complex data structures, it may produce false-negatives for deeper differences. Only extend PureComponent when you expect to have simple props and state, or use forceUpdate() when you know deep data structures have changed. Or, consider using immutable objects to facilitate fast comparisons of nested data. Furthermore, React.PureComponent’s shouldComponentUpdate() skips prop updates for the whole component subtree. Make sure all the children components are also “pure”.  
React.memo  const MyComponent = React.memo(function MyComponent(props) {
  /* render using props */
}); React.memo is a higher order component. If your component renders the same result given the same props, you can wrap it in a call to React.memo for a performance boost in some cases by memoizing the result. This means that React will skip rendering the component, and reuse the last rendered result. React.memo only checks for prop changes. If your function component wrapped in React.memo has a useState, useReducer or useContext Hook in its implementation, it will still rerender when state or context change. By default it will only shallowly compare complex objects in the props object. If you want control over the comparison, you can also provide a custom comparison function as the second argument. function MyComponent(props) {
  /* render using props */
}
function areEqual(prevProps, nextProps) {
  /*
  return true if passing nextProps to render would return
  the same result as passing prevProps to render,
  otherwise return false
  */
}
export default React.memo(MyComponent, areEqual); This method only exists as a performance optimization. Do not rely on it to “prevent” a render, as this can lead to bugs.  Note Unlike the shouldComponentUpdate() method on class components, the areEqual function returns true if the props are equal and false if the props are not equal. This is the inverse from shouldComponentUpdate.  
createElement()  React.createElement(
  type,
  [props],
  [...children]
) Create and return a new React element of the given type. The type argument can be either a tag name string (such as 'div' or 'span'), a React component type (a class or a function), or a React fragment type. Code written with JSX will be converted to use React.createElement(). You will not typically invoke React.createElement() directly if you are using JSX. See React Without JSX to learn more. 
cloneElement()  React.cloneElement(
  element,
  [config],
  [...children]
) Clone and return a new React element using element as the starting point. config should contain all new props, key, or ref. The resulting element will have the original element’s props with the new props merged in shallowly. New children will replace existing children. key and ref from the original element will be preserved if no key and ref present in the config. React.cloneElement() is almost equivalent to: <element.type {...element.props} {...props}>{children}</element.type> However, it also preserves refs. This means that if you get a child with a ref on it, you won’t accidentally steal it from your ancestor. You will get the same ref attached to your new element. The new ref or key will replace old ones if present. This API was introduced as a replacement of the deprecated React.addons.cloneWithProps(). 
createFactory()  React.createFactory(type) Return a function that produces React elements of a given type. Like React.createElement(), the type argument can be either a tag name string (such as 'div' or 'span'), a React component type (a class or a function), or a React fragment type. This helper is considered legacy, and we encourage you to either use JSX or use React.createElement() directly instead. You will not typically invoke React.createFactory() directly if you are using JSX. See React Without JSX to learn more. 
isValidElement()  React.isValidElement(object) Verifies the object is a React element. Returns true or false. 
React.Children  React.Children provides utilities for dealing with the this.props.children opaque data structure. 
React.Children.map  React.Children.map(children, function[(thisArg)]) Invokes a function on every immediate child contained within children with this set to thisArg. If children is an array it will be traversed and the function will be called for each child in the array. If children is null or undefined, this method will return null or undefined rather than an array.  Note If children is a Fragment it will be treated as a single child and not traversed.  
React.Children.forEach  React.Children.forEach(children, function[(thisArg)]) Like React.Children.map() but does not return an array. 
React.Children.count  React.Children.count(children) Returns the total number of components in children, equal to the number of times that a callback passed to map or forEach would be invoked. 
React.Children.only  React.Children.only(children) Verifies that children has only one child (a React element) and returns it. Otherwise this method throws an error.  Note: React.Children.only() does not accept the return value of React.Children.map() because it is an array rather than a React element.  
React.Children.toArray  React.Children.toArray(children) Returns the children opaque data structure as a flat array with keys assigned to each child. Useful if you want to manipulate collections of children in your render methods, especially if you want to reorder or slice this.props.children before passing it down.  Note: React.Children.toArray() changes keys to preserve the semantics of nested arrays when flattening lists of children. That is, toArray prefixes each key in the returned array so that each element’s key is scoped to the input array containing it.  
React.Fragment  The React.Fragment component lets you return multiple elements in a render() method without creating an additional DOM element: render() {
  return (
    <React.Fragment>
      Some text.
      <h2>A heading</h2>
    </React.Fragment>
  );
} You can also use it with the shorthand <></> syntax. For more information, see React v16.2.0: Improved Support for Fragments. 
React.createRef  React.createRef creates a ref that can be attached to React elements via the ref attribute. 
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.inputRef = React.createRef();
  }
  render() {
    return <input type="text" ref={this.inputRef} />;
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    this.inputRef.current.focus();
  }
} 
React.forwardRef  React.forwardRef creates a React component that forwards the ref attribute it receives to another component below in the tree. This technique is not very common but is particularly useful in two scenarios:  Forwarding refs to DOM components Forwarding refs in higher-order-components  React.forwardRef accepts a rendering function as an argument. React will call this function with props and ref as two arguments. This function should return a React node.
const FancyButton = React.forwardRef((props, ref) => (
  <button ref={ref} className="FancyButton">
    {props.children}
  </button>
));
// You can now get a ref directly to the DOM button:
const ref = React.createRef();
<FancyButton ref={ref}>Click me!</FancyButton>; In the above example, React passes a ref given to <FancyButton ref={ref}> element as a second argument to the rendering function inside the React.forwardRef call. This rendering function passes the ref to the <button ref={ref}> element. As a result, after React attaches the ref, ref.current will point directly to the <button> DOM element instance. For more information, see forwarding refs. 
React.lazy  React.lazy() lets you define a component that is loaded dynamically. This helps reduce the bundle size to delay loading components that aren’t used during the initial render. You can learn how to use it from our code splitting documentation. You might also want to check out this article explaining how to use it in more detail. // This component is loaded dynamically
const SomeComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./SomeComponent')); Note that rendering lazy components requires that there’s a <React.Suspense> component higher in the rendering tree. This is how you specify a loading indicator.  Note Using React.lazywith dynamic import requires Promises to be available in the JS environment. This requires a polyfill on IE11 and below.  
React.Suspense  React.Suspense lets you specify the loading indicator in case some components in the tree below it are not yet ready to render. Today, lazy loading components is the only use case supported by <React.Suspense>: // This component is loaded dynamically
const OtherComponent = React.lazy(() => import('./OtherComponent'));
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    // Displays <Spinner> until OtherComponent loads
    <React.Suspense fallback={<Spinner />}>
      <div>
        <OtherComponent />
      </div>
    </React.Suspense>
  );
} It is documented in our code splitting guide. Note that lazy components can be deep inside the Suspense tree — it doesn’t have to wrap every one of them. The best practice is to place <Suspense> where you want to see a loading indicator, but to use lazy() wherever you want to do code splitting. While this is not supported today, in the future we plan to let Suspense handle more scenarios such as data fetching. You can read about this in our roadmap.  Note: React.lazy() and <React.Suspense> are not yet supported by ReactDOMServer. This is a known limitation that will be resolved in the future.

-----------------------------------------------------------
React.Component
This page contains a detailed API reference for the React component class definition. It assumes you’re familiar with fundamental React concepts, such as Components and Props, as well as State and Lifecycle. If you’re not, read them first. Overview  React lets you define components as classes or functions. Components defined as classes currently provide more features which are described in detail on this page. To define a React component class, you need to extend React.Component: class Welcome extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
} The only method you must define in a React.Component subclass is called render(). All the other methods described on this page are optional. We strongly recommend against creating your own base component classes. In React components, code reuse is primarily achieved through composition rather than inheritance.  Note: React doesn’t force you to use the ES6 class syntax. If you prefer to avoid it, you may use the create-react-class module or a similar custom abstraction instead. Take a look at Using React without ES6 to learn more.  The Component Lifecycle  Each component has several “lifecycle methods” that you can override to run code at particular times in the process. You can use this lifecycle diagram as a cheat sheet. In the list below, commonly used lifecycle methods are marked as bold. The rest of them exist for relatively rare use cases. Mounting  These methods are called in the following order when an instance of a component is being created and inserted into the DOM:  constructor() static getDerivedStateFromProps() render() componentDidMount()   Note: These methods are considered legacy and you should avoid them in new code:  UNSAFE_componentWillMount()   Updating  An update can be caused by changes to props or state. These methods are called in the following order when a component is being re-rendered:  static getDerivedStateFromProps() shouldComponentUpdate() render() getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() componentDidUpdate()   Note: These methods are considered legacy and you should avoid them in new code:  UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate() UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps()   Unmounting  This method is called when a component is being removed from the DOM:  componentWillUnmount()  Error Handling  These methods are called when there is an error during rendering, in a lifecycle method, or in the constructor of any child component.  static getDerivedStateFromError() componentDidCatch()  Other APIs  Each component also provides some other APIs:  setState() forceUpdate()  Class Properties   defaultProps displayName  Instance Properties   props state  Reference  Commonly Used Lifecycle Methods  The methods in this section cover the vast majority of use cases you’ll encounter creating React components. For a visual reference, check out this lifecycle diagram. 
render()  render() The render() method is the only required method in a class component. When called, it should examine this.props and this.state and return one of the following types:  
React elements. Typically created via JSX. For example, <div /> and <MyComponent /> are React elements that instruct React to render a DOM node, or another user-defined component, respectively. 
Arrays and fragments. Let you return multiple elements from render. See the documentation on fragments for more details. 
Portals. Let you render children into a different DOM subtree. See the documentation on portals for more details. 
String and numbers. These are rendered as text nodes in the DOM. 
Booleans or null. Render nothing. (Mostly exists to support return test && <Child /> pattern, where test is boolean.)  The render() function should be pure, meaning that it does not modify component state, it returns the same result each time it’s invoked, and it does not directly interact with the browser. If you need to interact with the browser, perform your work in componentDidMount() or the other lifecycle methods instead. Keeping render() pure makes components easier to think about.  Note render() will not be invoked if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.  
constructor()  constructor(props) If you don’t initialize state and you don’t bind methods, you don’t need to implement a constructor for your React component. The constructor for a React component is called before it is mounted. When implementing the constructor for a React.Component subclass, you should call super(props) before any other statement. Otherwise, this.props will be undefined in the constructor, which can lead to bugs. Typically, in React constructors are only used for two purposes:  Initializing local state by assigning an object to this.state. Binding event handler methods to an instance.  You should not call setState() in the constructor(). Instead, if your component needs to use local state, assign the initial state to this.state directly in the constructor: constructor(props) {
  super(props);
  // Don't call this.setState() here!
  this.state = { counter: 0 };
  this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
} Constructor is the only place where you should assign this.state directly. In all other methods, you need to use this.setState() instead. Avoid introducing any side-effects or subscriptions in the constructor. For those use cases, use componentDidMount() instead.  Note Avoid copying props into state! This is a common mistake: constructor(props) {
 super(props);
 // Don't do this!
 this.state = { color: props.color };
} The problem is that it’s both unnecessary (you can use this.props.color directly instead), and creates bugs (updates to the color prop won’t be reflected in the state). Only use this pattern if you intentionally want to ignore prop updates. In that case, it makes sense to rename the prop to be called initialColor or defaultColor. You can then force a component to “reset” its internal state by changing its key when necessary. Read our blog post on avoiding derived state to learn about what to do if you think you need some state to depend on the props.  
componentDidMount()  componentDidMount() componentDidMount() is invoked immediately after a component is mounted (inserted into the tree). Initialization that requires DOM nodes should go here. If you need to load data from a remote endpoint, this is a good place to instantiate the network request. This method is a good place to set up any subscriptions. If you do that, don’t forget to unsubscribe in componentWillUnmount(). You may call setState() immediately in componentDidMount(). It will trigger an extra rendering, but it will happen before the browser updates the screen. This guarantees that even though the render() will be called twice in this case, the user won’t see the intermediate state. Use this pattern with caution because it often causes performance issues. In most cases, you should be able to assign the initial state in the constructor() instead. It can, however, be necessary for cases like modals and tooltips when you need to measure a DOM node before rendering something that depends on its size or position. 
componentDidUpdate()  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot) componentDidUpdate() is invoked immediately after updating occurs. This method is not called for the initial render. Use this as an opportunity to operate on the DOM when the component has been updated. This is also a good place to do network requests as long as you compare the current props to previous props (e.g. a network request may not be necessary if the props have not changed). componentDidUpdate(prevProps) {
  // Typical usage (don't forget to compare props):
  if (this.props.userID !== prevProps.userID) {
    this.fetchData(this.props.userID);
  }
} You may call setState() immediately in componentDidUpdate() but note that it must be wrapped in a condition like in the example above, or you’ll cause an infinite loop. It would also cause an extra re-rendering which, while not visible to the user, can affect the component performance. If you’re trying to “mirror” some state to a prop coming from above, consider using the prop directly instead. Read more about why copying props into state causes bugs. If your component implements the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() lifecycle (which is rare), the value it returns will be passed as a third “snapshot” parameter to componentDidUpdate(). Otherwise this parameter will be undefined.  Note componentDidUpdate() will not be invoked if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.  
componentWillUnmount()  componentWillUnmount() componentWillUnmount() is invoked immediately before a component is unmounted and destroyed. Perform any necessary cleanup in this method, such as invalidating timers, canceling network requests, or cleaning up any subscriptions that were created in componentDidMount(). You should not call setState() in componentWillUnmount() because the component will never be re-rendered. Once a component instance is unmounted, it will never be mounted again. Rarely Used Lifecycle Methods  The methods in this section correspond to uncommon use cases. They’re handy once in a while, but most of your components probably don’t need any of them. You can see most of the methods below on this lifecycle diagram if you click the “Show less common lifecycles” checkbox at the top of it. 
shouldComponentUpdate()  shouldComponentUpdate(nextProps, nextState) Use shouldComponentUpdate() to let React know if a component’s output is not affected by the current change in state or props. The default behavior is to re-render on every state change, and in the vast majority of cases you should rely on the default behavior. shouldComponentUpdate() is invoked before rendering when new props or state are being received. Defaults to true. This method is not called for the initial render or when forceUpdate() is used. This method only exists as a performance optimization. Do not rely on it to “prevent” a rendering, as this can lead to bugs. Consider using the built-in PureComponent instead of writing shouldComponentUpdate() by hand. PureComponent performs a shallow comparison of props and state, and reduces the chance that you’ll skip a necessary update. If you are confident you want to write it by hand, you may compare this.props with nextProps and this.state with nextState and return false to tell React the update can be skipped. Note that returning false does not prevent child components from re-rendering when their state changes. We do not recommend doing deep equality checks or using JSON.stringify() in shouldComponentUpdate(). It is very inefficient and will harm performance. Currently, if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false, then UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate(), render(), and componentDidUpdate() will not be invoked. In the future React may treat shouldComponentUpdate() as a hint rather than a strict directive, and returning false may still result in a re-rendering of the component. 
static getDerivedStateFromProps()  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) getDerivedStateFromProps is invoked right before calling the render method, both on the initial mount and on subsequent updates. It should return an object to update the state, or null to update nothing. This method exists for rare use cases where the state depends on changes in props over time. For example, it might be handy for implementing a <Transition> component that compares its previous and next children to decide which of them to animate in and out. Deriving state leads to verbose code and makes your components difficult to think about. Make sure you’re familiar with simpler alternatives:  If you need to perform a side effect (for example, data fetching or an animation) in response to a change in props, use componentDidUpdate lifecycle instead. If you want to re-compute some data only when a prop changes, use a memoization helper instead. If you want to “reset” some state when a prop changes, consider either making a component fully controlled or fully uncontrolled with a key instead.  This method doesn’t have access to the component instance. If you’d like, you can reuse some code between getDerivedStateFromProps() and the other class methods by extracting pure functions of the component props and state outside the class definition. Note that this method is fired on every render, regardless of the cause. This is in contrast to UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps, which only fires when the parent causes a re-render and not as a result of a local setState. 
getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() is invoked right before the most recently rendered output is committed to e.g. the DOM. It enables your component to capture some information from the DOM (e.g. scroll position) before it is potentially changed. Any value returned by this lifecycle method will be passed as a parameter to componentDidUpdate(). This use case is not common, but it may occur in UIs like a chat thread that need to handle scroll position in a special way. A snapshot value (or null) should be returned. For example:
class ScrollingList extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.listRef = React.createRef();
  }
  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    // Are we adding new items to the list?
    // Capture the scroll position so we can adjust scroll later.
    if (prevProps.list.length < this.props.list.length) {
      const list = this.listRef.current;
      return list.scrollHeight - list.scrollTop;
    }
    return null;
  }
  componentDidUpdate(prevProps, prevState, snapshot) {
    // If we have a snapshot value, we've just added new items.
    // Adjust scroll so these new items don't push the old ones out of view.
    // (snapshot here is the value returned from getSnapshotBeforeUpdate)
    if (snapshot !== null) {
      const list = this.listRef.current;
      list.scrollTop = list.scrollHeight - snapshot;
    }
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div ref={this.listRef}>{/* ...contents... */}</div>
    );
  }
} In the above examples, it is important to read the scrollHeight property in getSnapshotBeforeUpdate because there may be delays between “render” phase lifecycles (like render) and “commit” phase lifecycles (like getSnapshotBeforeUpdate and componentDidUpdate). Error boundaries  Error boundaries are React components that catch JavaScript errors anywhere in their child component tree, log those errors, and display a fallback UI instead of the component tree that crashed. Error boundaries catch errors during rendering, in lifecycle methods, and in constructors of the whole tree below them. A class component becomes an error boundary if it defines either (or both) of the lifecycle methods static getDerivedStateFromError() or componentDidCatch(). Updating state from these lifecycles lets you capture an unhandled JavaScript error in the below tree and display a fallback UI. Only use error boundaries for recovering from unexpected exceptions; don’t try to use them for control flow. For more details, see Error Handling in React 16.  Note Error boundaries only catch errors in the components below them in the tree. An error boundary can’t catch an error within itself.  
static getDerivedStateFromError()  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) This lifecycle is invoked after an error has been thrown by a descendant component. It receives the error that was thrown as a parameter and should return a value to update state. class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }
  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
    return { hasError: true };
  }
  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // You can render any custom fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
}  Note getDerivedStateFromError() is called during the “render” phase, so side-effects are not permitted. For those use cases, use componentDidCatch() instead.  
componentDidCatch()  componentDidCatch(error, info) This lifecycle is invoked after an error has been thrown by a descendant component. It receives two parameters:  
error - The error that was thrown. 
info - An object with a componentStack key containing information about which component threw the error.  componentDidCatch() is called during the “commit” phase, so side-effects are permitted. It should be used for things like logging errors: class ErrorBoundary extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = { hasError: false };
  }
  static getDerivedStateFromError(error) {
    // Update state so the next render will show the fallback UI.
    return { hasError: true };
  }
  componentDidCatch(error, info) {
    // Example "componentStack":
    //   in ComponentThatThrows (created by App)
    //   in ErrorBoundary (created by App)
    //   in div (created by App)
    //   in App
    logComponentStackToMyService(info.componentStack);
  }
  render() {
    if (this.state.hasError) {
      // You can render any custom fallback UI
      return <h1>Something went wrong.</h1>;
    }
    return this.props.children;
  }
} Production and development builds of React slightly differ in the way componentDidCatch() handles errors. On development, the errors will bubble up to window, this means that any window.onerror or window.addEventListener('error', callback) will intercept the errors that have been caught by componentDidCatch(). On production, instead, the errors will not bubble up, which means any ancestor error handler will only receive errors not explicitly caught by componentDidCatch().  Note In the event of an error, you can render a fallback UI with componentDidCatch() by calling setState, but this will be deprecated in a future release. Use static getDerivedStateFromError() to handle fallback rendering instead.  Legacy Lifecycle Methods  The lifecycle methods below are marked as “legacy”. They still work, but we don’t recommend using them in the new code. You can learn more about migrating away from legacy lifecycle methods in this blog post. 
UNSAFE_componentWillMount()  UNSAFE_componentWillMount()  Note This lifecycle was previously named componentWillMount. That name will continue to work until version 17. Use the rename-unsafe-lifecycles codemod to automatically update your components.  UNSAFE_componentWillMount() is invoked just before mounting occurs. It is called before render(), therefore calling setState() synchronously in this method will not trigger an extra rendering. Generally, we recommend using the constructor() instead for initializing state. Avoid introducing any side-effects or subscriptions in this method. For those use cases, use componentDidMount() instead. This is the only lifecycle method called on server rendering. 
UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps()  UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps(nextProps)  Note This lifecycle was previously named componentWillReceiveProps. That name will continue to work until version 17. Use the rename-unsafe-lifecycles codemod to automatically update your components.   Note: Using this lifecycle method often leads to bugs and inconsistencies  If you need to perform a side effect (for example, data fetching or an animation) in response to a change in props, use componentDidUpdate lifecycle instead. If you used componentWillReceiveProps for re-computing some data only when a prop changes, use a memoization helper instead. If you used componentWillReceiveProps to “reset” some state when a prop changes, consider either making a component fully controlled or fully uncontrolled with a key instead.  For other use cases, follow the recommendations in this blog post about derived state.  UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps() is invoked before a mounted component receives new props. If you need to update the state in response to prop changes (for example, to reset it), you may compare this.props and nextProps and perform state transitions using this.setState() in this method. Note that if a parent component causes your component to re-render, this method will be called even if props have not changed. Make sure to compare the current and next values if you only want to handle changes. React doesn’t call UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps() with initial props during mounting. It only calls this method if some of component’s props may update. Calling this.setState() generally doesn’t trigger UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps(). 
UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate()  UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate(nextProps, nextState)  Note This lifecycle was previously named componentWillUpdate. That name will continue to work until version 17. Use the rename-unsafe-lifecycles codemod to automatically update your components.  UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate() is invoked just before rendering when new props or state are being received. Use this as an opportunity to perform preparation before an update occurs. This method is not called for the initial render. Note that you cannot call this.setState() here; nor should you do anything else (e.g. dispatch a Redux action) that would trigger an update to a React component before UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate() returns. Typically, this method can be replaced by componentDidUpdate(). If you were reading from the DOM in this method (e.g. to save a scroll position), you can move that logic to getSnapshotBeforeUpdate().  Note UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate() will not be invoked if shouldComponentUpdate() returns false.  Other APIs  Unlike the lifecycle methods above (which React calls for you), the methods below are the methods you can call from your components. There are just two of them: setState() and forceUpdate(). 
setState()  setState(updater, [callback]) setState() enqueues changes to the component state and tells React that this component and its children need to be re-rendered with the updated state. This is the primary method you use to update the user interface in response to event handlers and server responses. Think of setState() as a request rather than an immediate command to update the component. For better perceived performance, React may delay it, and then update several components in a single pass. React does not guarantee that the state changes are applied immediately. setState() does not always immediately update the component. It may batch or defer the update until later. This makes reading this.state right after calling setState() a potential pitfall. Instead, use componentDidUpdate or a setState callback (setState(updater, callback)), either of which are guaranteed to fire after the update has been applied. If you need to set the state based on the previous state, read about the updater argument below. setState() will always lead to a re-render unless shouldComponentUpdate() returns false. If mutable objects are being used and conditional rendering logic cannot be implemented in shouldComponentUpdate(), calling setState() only when the new state differs from the previous state will avoid unnecessary re-renders. The first argument is an updater function with the signature: (state, props) => stateChange state is a reference to the component state at the time the change is being applied. It should not be directly mutated. Instead, changes should be represented by building a new object based on the input from state and props. For instance, suppose we wanted to increment a value in state by props.step: this.setState((state, props) => {
  return {counter: state.counter + props.step};
}); Both state and props received by the updater function are guaranteed to be up-to-date. The output of the updater is shallowly merged with state. The second parameter to setState() is an optional callback function that will be executed once setState is completed and the component is re-rendered. Generally we recommend using componentDidUpdate() for such logic instead. You may optionally pass an object as the first argument to setState() instead of a function: setState(stateChange[, callback]) This performs a shallow merge of stateChange into the new state, e.g., to adjust a shopping cart item quantity: this.setState({quantity: 2}) This form of setState() is also asynchronous, and multiple calls during the same cycle may be batched together. For example, if you attempt to increment an item quantity more than once in the same cycle, that will result in the equivalent of: Object.assign(
  previousState,
  {quantity: state.quantity + 1},
  {quantity: state.quantity + 1},
  ...
) Subsequent calls will override values from previous calls in the same cycle, so the quantity will only be incremented once. If the next state depends on the current state, we recommend using the updater function form, instead: this.setState((state) => {
  return {quantity: state.quantity + 1};
}); For more detail, see:  State and Lifecycle guide In depth: When and why are setState() calls batched? In depth: Why isn’t this.state updated immediately?  
forceUpdate()  component.forceUpdate(callback) By default, when your component’s state or props change, your component will re-render. If your render() method depends on some other data, you can tell React that the component needs re-rendering by calling forceUpdate(). Calling forceUpdate() will cause render() to be called on the component, skipping shouldComponentUpdate(). This will trigger the normal lifecycle methods for child components, including the shouldComponentUpdate() method of each child. React will still only update the DOM if the markup changes. Normally you should try to avoid all uses of forceUpdate() and only read from this.props and this.state in render(). Class Properties  
defaultProps  defaultProps can be defined as a property on the component class itself, to set the default props for the class. This is used for undefined props, but not for null props. For example: class CustomButton extends React.Component {
  // ...
}
CustomButton.defaultProps = {
  color: 'blue'
}; If props.color is not provided, it will be set by default to 'blue':   render() {
    return <CustomButton /> ; // props.color will be set to blue
  } If props.color is set to null, it will remain null:   render() {
    return <CustomButton color={null} /> ; // props.color will remain null
  } 
displayName  The displayName string is used in debugging messages. Usually, you don’t need to set it explicitly because it’s inferred from the name of the function or class that defines the component. You might want to set it explicitly if you want to display a different name for debugging purposes or when you create a higher-order component, see Wrap the Display Name for Easy Debugging for details. Instance Properties  
props  this.props contains the props that were defined by the caller of this component. See Components and Props for an introduction to props. In particular, this.props.children is a special prop, typically defined by the child tags in the JSX expression rather than in the tag itself. 
state  The state contains data specific to this component that may change over time. The state is user-defined, and it should be a plain JavaScript object. If some value isn’t used for rendering or data flow (for example, a timer ID), you don’t have to put it in the state. Such values can be defined as fields on the component instance. See State and Lifecycle for more information about the state. Never mutate this.state directly, as calling setState() afterwards may replace the mutation you made. Treat this.state as if it were immutable.

react-dom
-----------------------------------------------------------
ReactDOM
If you load React from a <script> tag, these top-level APIs are available on the ReactDOM global. If you use ES6 with npm, you can write import ReactDOM from 'react-dom'. If you use ES5 with npm, you can write var ReactDOM = require('react-dom'). Overview  The react-dom package provides DOM-specific methods that can be used at the top level of your app and as an escape hatch to get outside of the React model if you need to. Most of your components should not need to use this module.  render() hydrate() unmountComponentAtNode() findDOMNode() createPortal()  Browser Support  React supports all popular browsers, including Internet Explorer 9 and above, although some polyfills are required for older browsers such as IE 9 and IE 10.  Note We don’t support older browsers that don’t support ES5 methods, but you may find that your apps do work in older browsers if polyfills such as es5-shim and es5-sham are included in the page. You’re on your own if you choose to take this path.  Reference  
render()  ReactDOM.render(element, container[, callback]) Render a React element into the DOM in the supplied container and return a reference to the component (or returns null for stateless components). If the React element was previously rendered into container, this will perform an update on it and only mutate the DOM as necessary to reflect the latest React element. If the optional callback is provided, it will be executed after the component is rendered or updated.  Note: ReactDOM.render() controls the contents of the container node you pass in. Any existing DOM elements inside are replaced when first called. Later calls use React’s DOM diffing algorithm for efficient updates. ReactDOM.render() does not modify the container node (only modifies the children of the container). It may be possible to insert a component to an existing DOM node without overwriting the existing children. ReactDOM.render() currently returns a reference to the root ReactComponent instance. However, using this return value is legacy and should be avoided because future versions of React may render components asynchronously in some cases. If you need a reference to the root ReactComponent instance, the preferred solution is to attach a callback ref to the root element. Using ReactDOM.render() to hydrate a server-rendered container is deprecated and will be removed in React 17. Use hydrate() instead.  
hydrate()  ReactDOM.hydrate(element, container[, callback]) Same as render(), but is used to hydrate a container whose HTML contents were rendered by ReactDOMServer. React will attempt to attach event listeners to the existing markup. React expects that the rendered content is identical between the server and the client. It can patch up differences in text content, but you should treat mismatches as bugs and fix them. In development mode, React warns about mismatches during hydration. There are no guarantees that attribute differences will be patched up in case of mismatches. This is important for performance reasons because in most apps, mismatches are rare, and so validating all markup would be prohibitively expensive. If a single element’s attribute or text content is unavoidably different between the server and the client (for example, a timestamp), you may silence the warning by adding suppressHydrationWarning={true} to the element. It only works one level deep, and is intended to be an escape hatch. Don’t overuse it. Unless it’s text content, React still won’t attempt to patch it up, so it may remain inconsistent until future updates. If you intentionally need to render something different on the server and the client, you can do a two-pass rendering. Components that render something different on the client can read a state variable like this.state.isClient, which you can set to true in componentDidMount(). This way the initial render pass will render the same content as the server, avoiding mismatches, but an additional pass will happen synchronously right after hydration. Note that this approach will make your components slower because they have to render twice, so use it with caution. Remember to be mindful of user experience on slow connections. The JavaScript code may load significantly later than the initial HTML render, so if you render something different in the client-only pass, the transition can be jarring. However, if executed well, it may be beneficial to render a “shell” of the application on the server, and only show some of the extra widgets on the client. To learn how to do this without getting the markup mismatch issues, refer to the explanation in the previous paragraph. 
unmountComponentAtNode()  ReactDOM.unmountComponentAtNode(container) Remove a mounted React component from the DOM and clean up its event handlers and state. If no component was mounted in the container, calling this function does nothing. Returns true if a component was unmounted and false if there was no component to unmount. 
findDOMNode()   Note: findDOMNode is an escape hatch used to access the underlying DOM node. In most cases, use of this escape hatch is discouraged because it pierces the component abstraction. It has been deprecated in StrictMode.  ReactDOM.findDOMNode(component) If this component has been mounted into the DOM, this returns the corresponding native browser DOM element. This method is useful for reading values out of the DOM, such as form field values and performing DOM measurements. In most cases, you can attach a ref to the DOM node and avoid using findDOMNode at all. When a component renders to null or false, findDOMNode returns null. When a component renders to a string, findDOMNode returns a text DOM node containing that value. As of React 16, a component may return a fragment with multiple children, in which case findDOMNode will return the DOM node corresponding to the first non-empty child.  Note: findDOMNode only works on mounted components (that is, components that have been placed in the DOM). If you try to call this on a component that has not been mounted yet (like calling findDOMNode() in render() on a component that has yet to be created) an exception will be thrown. findDOMNode cannot be used on function components.  
createPortal()  ReactDOM.createPortal(child, container) Creates a portal. Portals provide a way to render children into a DOM node that exists outside the hierarchy of the DOM component.

react-dom-server
-----------------------------------------------------------
ReactDOMServer
The ReactDOMServer object enables you to render components to static markup. Typically, it’s used on a Node server: // ES modules
import ReactDOMServer from 'react-dom/server';
// CommonJS
var ReactDOMServer = require('react-dom/server'); Overview  The following methods can be used in both the server and browser environments:  renderToString() renderToStaticMarkup()  These additional methods depend on a package (stream) that is only available on the server, and won’t work in the browser.  renderToNodeStream() renderToStaticNodeStream()  Reference  
renderToString()  ReactDOMServer.renderToString(element) Render a React element to its initial HTML. React will return an HTML string. You can use this method to generate HTML on the server and send the markup down on the initial request for faster page loads and to allow search engines to crawl your pages for SEO purposes. If you call ReactDOM.hydrate() on a node that already has this server-rendered markup, React will preserve it and only attach event handlers, allowing you to have a very performant first-load experience. 
renderToStaticMarkup()  ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup(element) Similar to renderToString, except this doesn’t create extra DOM attributes that React uses internally, such as data-reactroot. This is useful if you want to use React as a simple static page generator, as stripping away the extra attributes can save some bytes. If you plan to use React on the client to make the markup interactive, do not use this method. Instead, use renderToString on the server and ReactDOM.hydrate() on the client. 
renderToNodeStream()  ReactDOMServer.renderToNodeStream(element) Render a React element to its initial HTML. Returns a Readable stream that outputs an HTML string. The HTML output by this stream is exactly equal to what ReactDOMServer.renderToString would return. You can use this method to generate HTML on the server and send the markup down on the initial request for faster page loads and to allow search engines to crawl your pages for SEO purposes. If you call ReactDOM.hydrate() on a node that already has this server-rendered markup, React will preserve it and only attach event handlers, allowing you to have a very performant first-load experience.  Note: Server-only. This API is not available in the browser. The stream returned from this method will return a byte stream encoded in utf-8. If you need a stream in another encoding, take a look at a project like iconv-lite, which provides transform streams for transcoding text.  
renderToStaticNodeStream()  ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticNodeStream(element) Similar to renderToNodeStream, except this doesn’t create extra DOM attributes that React uses internally, such as data-reactroot. This is useful if you want to use React as a simple static page generator, as stripping away the extra attributes can save some bytes. The HTML output by this stream is exactly equal to what ReactDOMServer.renderToStaticMarkup would return. If you plan to use React on the client to make the markup interactive, do not use this method. Instead, use renderToNodeStream on the server and ReactDOM.hydrate() on the client.  Note: Server-only. This API is not available in the browser. The stream returned from this method will return a byte stream encoded in utf-8. If you need a stream in another encoding, take a look at a project like iconv-lite, which provides transform streams for transcoding text.

react-without-es6
-----------------------------------------------------------
React Without ES6
Normally you would define a React component as a plain JavaScript class: class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
} If you don’t use ES6 yet, you may use the create-react-class module instead: var createReactClass = require('create-react-class');
var Greeting = createReactClass({
  render: function() {
    return <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>;
  }
}); The API of ES6 classes is similar to createReactClass() with a few exceptions. Declaring Default Props  With functions and ES6 classes defaultProps is defined as a property on the component itself: class Greeting extends React.Component {
  // ...
}
Greeting.defaultProps = {
  name: 'Mary'
}; With createReactClass(), you need to define getDefaultProps() as a function on the passed object: var Greeting = createReactClass({
  getDefaultProps: function() {
    return {
      name: 'Mary'
    };
  },
  // ...
}); Setting the Initial State  In ES6 classes, you can define the initial state by assigning this.state in the constructor: class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {count: props.initialCount};
  }
  // ...
} With createReactClass(), you have to provide a separate getInitialState method that returns the initial state: var Counter = createReactClass({
  getInitialState: function() {
    return {count: this.props.initialCount};
  },
  // ...
}); Autobinding  In React components declared as ES6 classes, methods follow the same semantics as regular ES6 classes. This means that they don’t automatically bind this to the instance. You’ll have to explicitly use .bind(this) in the constructor: class SayHello extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {message: 'Hello!'};
    // This line is important!
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }
  handleClick() {
    alert(this.state.message);
  }
  render() {
    // Because `this.handleClick` is bound, we can use it as an event handler.
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        Say hello
      </button>
    );
  }
} With createReactClass(), this is not necessary because it binds all methods: var SayHello = createReactClass({
  getInitialState: function() {
    return {message: 'Hello!'};
  },
  handleClick: function() {
    alert(this.state.message);
  },
  render: function() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        Say hello
      </button>
    );
  }
}); This means writing ES6 classes comes with a little more boilerplate code for event handlers, but the upside is slightly better performance in large applications. If the boilerplate code is too unattractive to you, you may enable the experimental Class Properties syntax proposal with Babel: class SayHello extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {message: 'Hello!'};
  }
  // WARNING: this syntax is experimental!
  // Using an arrow here binds the method:
  handleClick = () => {
    alert(this.state.message);
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
        Say hello
      </button>
    );
  }
} Please note that the syntax above is experimental and the syntax may change, or the proposal might not make it into the language. If you’d rather play it safe, you have a few options:  Bind methods in the constructor. Use arrow functions, e.g. onClick={(e) => this.handleClick(e)}. Keep using createReactClass.  Mixins   Note: ES6 launched without any mixin support. Therefore, there is no support for mixins when you use React with ES6 classes. We also found numerous issues in codebases using mixins, and don’t recommend using them in the new code. This section exists only for the reference.  Sometimes very different components may share some common functionality. These are sometimes called cross-cutting concerns. createReactClass lets you use a legacy mixins system for that. One common use case is a component wanting to update itself on a time interval. It’s easy to use setInterval(), but it’s important to cancel your interval when you don’t need it anymore to save memory. React provides lifecycle methods that let you know when a component is about to be created or destroyed. Let’s create a simple mixin that uses these methods to provide an easy setInterval() function that will automatically get cleaned up when your component is destroyed. var SetIntervalMixin = {
  componentWillMount: function() {
    this.intervals = [];
  },
  setInterval: function() {
    this.intervals.push(setInterval.apply(null, arguments));
  },
  componentWillUnmount: function() {
    this.intervals.forEach(clearInterval);
  }
};
var createReactClass = require('create-react-class');
var TickTock = createReactClass({
  mixins: [SetIntervalMixin], // Use the mixin
  getInitialState: function() {
    return {seconds: 0};
  },
  componentDidMount: function() {
    this.setInterval(this.tick, 1000); // Call a method on the mixin
  },
  tick: function() {
    this.setState({seconds: this.state.seconds + 1});
  },
  render: function() {
    return (
      <p>
        React has been running for {this.state.seconds} seconds.
      </p>
    );
  }
});
ReactDOM.render(
  <TickTock />,
  document.getElementById('example')
); If a component is using multiple mixins and several mixins define the same lifecycle method (i.e. several mixins want to do some cleanup when the component is destroyed), all of the lifecycle methods are guaranteed to be called. Methods defined on mixins run in the order mixins were listed, followed by a method call on the component.

react-without-jsx
-----------------------------------------------------------
React Without JSX
JSX is not a requirement for using React. Using React without JSX is especially convenient when you don’t want to set up compilation in your build environment. Each JSX element is just syntactic sugar for calling React.createElement(component, props, ...children). So, anything you can do with JSX can also be done with just plain JavaScript. For example, this code written with JSX: class Hello extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello {this.props.toWhat}</div>;
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(
  <Hello toWhat="World" />,
  document.getElementById('root')
); can be compiled to this code that does not use JSX: class Hello extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return React.createElement('div', null, `Hello ${this.props.toWhat}`);
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(
  React.createElement(Hello, {toWhat: 'World'}, null),
  document.getElementById('root')
); If you’re curious to see more examples of how JSX is converted to JavaScript, you can try out the online Babel compiler. The component can either be provided as a string, as a subclass of React.Component, or a plain function. If you get tired of typing React.createElement so much, one common pattern is to assign a shorthand: const e = React.createElement;
ReactDOM.render(
  e('div', null, 'Hello World'),
  document.getElementById('root')
); If you use this shorthand form for React.createElement, it can be almost as convenient to use React without JSX. Alternatively, you can refer to community projects such as react-hyperscript and hyperscript-helpers which offer a terser syntax.

reconciliation
-----------------------------------------------------------
Reconciliation
React provides a declarative API so that you don’t have to worry about exactly what changes on every update. This makes writing applications a lot easier, but it might not be obvious how this is implemented within React. This article explains the choices we made in React’s “diffing” algorithm so that component updates are predictable while being fast enough for high-performance apps. Motivation  When you use React, at a single point in time you can think of the render() function as creating a tree of React elements. On the next state or props update, that render() function will return a different tree of React elements. React then needs to figure out how to efficiently update the UI to match the most recent tree. There are some generic solutions to this algorithmic problem of generating the minimum number of operations to transform one tree into another. However, the state of the art algorithms have a complexity in the order of O(n3) where n is the number of elements in the tree. If we used this in React, displaying 1000 elements would require in the order of one billion comparisons. This is far too expensive. Instead, React implements a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:  Two elements of different types will produce different trees. The developer can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a key prop.  In practice, these assumptions are valid for almost all practical use cases. The Diffing Algorithm  When diffing two trees, React first compares the two root elements. The behavior is different depending on the types of the root elements. Elements Of Different Types  Whenever the root elements have different types, React will tear down the old tree and build the new tree from scratch. Going from <a> to <img>, or from <Article> to <Comment>, or from <Button> to <div> - any of those will lead to a full rebuild. When tearing down a tree, old DOM nodes are destroyed. Component instances receive componentWillUnmount(). When building up a new tree, new DOM nodes are inserted into the DOM. Component instances receive UNSAFE_componentWillMount() and then componentDidMount(). Any state associated with the old tree is lost. Any components below the root will also get unmounted and have their state destroyed. For example, when diffing: <div>
  <Counter />
</div>
<span>
  <Counter />
</span> This will destroy the old Counter and remount a new one.  Note: These methods are considered legacy and you should avoid them in new code:  UNSAFE_componentWillMount()   DOM Elements Of The Same Type  When comparing two React DOM elements of the same type, React looks at the attributes of both, keeps the same underlying DOM node, and only updates the changed attributes. For example: <div className="before" title="stuff" />
<div className="after" title="stuff" /> By comparing these two elements, React knows to only modify the className on the underlying DOM node. When updating style, React also knows to update only the properties that changed. For example: <div style={{color: 'red', fontWeight: 'bold'}} />
<div style={{color: 'green', fontWeight: 'bold'}} /> When converting between these two elements, React knows to only modify the color style, not the fontWeight. After handling the DOM node, React then recurses on the children. Component Elements Of The Same Type  When a component updates, the instance stays the same, so that state is maintained across renders. React updates the props of the underlying component instance to match the new element, and calls UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps(), UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate() and componentDidUpdate() on the underlying instance. Next, the render() method is called and the diff algorithm recurses on the previous result and the new result.  Note: These methods are considered legacy and you should avoid them in new code:  UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate() UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps()   Recursing On Children  By default, when recursing on the children of a DOM node, React just iterates over both lists of children at the same time and generates a mutation whenever there’s a difference. For example, when adding an element at the end of the children, converting between these two trees works well: <ul>
  <li>first</li>
  <li>second</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>first</li>
  <li>second</li>
  <li>third</li>
</ul> React will match the two <li>first</li> trees, match the two <li>second</li> trees, and then insert the <li>third</li> tree. If you implement it naively, inserting an element at the beginning has worse performance. For example, converting between these two trees works poorly: <ul>
  <li>Duke</li>
  <li>Villanova</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li>Connecticut</li>
  <li>Duke</li>
  <li>Villanova</li>
</ul> React will mutate every child instead of realizing it can keep the <li>Duke</li> and <li>Villanova</li> subtrees intact. This inefficiency can be a problem. Keys  In order to solve this issue, React supports a key attribute. When children have keys, React uses the key to match children in the original tree with children in the subsequent tree. For example, adding a key to our inefficient example above can make the tree conversion efficient: <ul>
  <li key="2015">Duke</li>
  <li key="2016">Villanova</li>
</ul>
<ul>
  <li key="2014">Connecticut</li>
  <li key="2015">Duke</li>
  <li key="2016">Villanova</li>
</ul> Now React knows that the element with key '2014' is the new one, and the elements with the keys '2015' and '2016' have just moved. In practice, finding a key is usually not hard. The element you are going to display may already have a unique ID, so the key can just come from your data: <li key={item.id}>{item.name}</li> When that’s not the case, you can add a new ID property to your model or hash some parts of the content to generate a key. The key only has to be unique among its siblings, not globally unique. As a last resort, you can pass an item’s index in the array as a key. This can work well if the items are never reordered, but reorders will be slow. Reorders can also cause issues with component state when indexes are used as keys. Component instances are updated and reused based on their key. If the key is an index, moving an item changes it. As a result, component state for things like uncontrolled inputs can get mixed up and updated in unexpected ways. Here is an example of the issues that can be caused by using indexes as keys on CodePen, and here is an updated version of the same example showing how not using indexes as keys will fix these reordering, sorting, and prepending issues. Tradeoffs  It is important to remember that the reconciliation algorithm is an implementation detail. React could rerender the whole app on every action; the end result would be the same. Just to be clear, rerender in this context means calling render for all components, it doesn’t mean React will unmount and remount them. It will only apply the differences following the rules stated in the previous sections. We are regularly refining the heuristics in order to make common use cases faster. In the current implementation, you can express the fact that a subtree has been moved amongst its siblings, but you cannot tell that it has moved somewhere else. The algorithm will rerender that full subtree. Because React relies on heuristics, if the assumptions behind them are not met, performance will suffer.  The algorithm will not try to match subtrees of different component types. If you see yourself alternating between two component types with very similar output, you may want to make it the same type. In practice, we haven’t found this to be an issue. Keys should be stable, predictable, and unique. Unstable keys (like those produced by Math.random()) will cause many component instances and DOM nodes to be unnecessarily recreated, which can cause performance degradation and lost state in child components.

refs-and-the-dom
-----------------------------------------------------------
Refs and the DOM
Refs provide a way to access DOM nodes or React elements created in the render method. In the typical React dataflow, props are the only way that parent components interact with their children. To modify a child, you re-render it with new props. However, there are a few cases where you need to imperatively modify a child outside of the typical dataflow. The child to be modified could be an instance of a React component, or it could be a DOM element. For both of these cases, React provides an escape hatch. When to Use Refs  There are a few good use cases for refs:  Managing focus, text selection, or media playback. Triggering imperative animations. Integrating with third-party DOM libraries.  Avoid using refs for anything that can be done declaratively. For example, instead of exposing open() and close() methods on a Dialog component, pass an isOpen prop to it. Don’t Overuse Refs  Your first inclination may be to use refs to “make things happen” in your app. If this is the case, take a moment and think more critically about where state should be owned in the component hierarchy. Often, it becomes clear that the proper place to “own” that state is at a higher level in the hierarchy. See the Lifting State Up guide for examples of this.  Note The examples below have been updated to use the React.createRef() API introduced in React 16.3. If you are using an earlier release of React, we recommend using callback refs instead.  Creating Refs  Refs are created using React.createRef() and attached to React elements via the ref attribute. Refs are commonly assigned to an instance property when a component is constructed so they can be referenced throughout the component. class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.myRef = React.createRef();
  }
  render() {
    return <div ref={this.myRef} />;
  }
} Accessing Refs  When a ref is passed to an element in render, a reference to the node becomes accessible at the current attribute of the ref. const node = this.myRef.current; The value of the ref differs depending on the type of the node:  When the ref attribute is used on an HTML element, the ref created in the constructor with React.createRef() receives the underlying DOM element as its current property. When the ref attribute is used on a custom class component, the ref object receives the mounted instance of the component as its current. 
You may not use the ref attribute on function components because they don’t have instances.  The examples below demonstrate the differences. Adding a Ref to a DOM Element  This code uses a ref to store a reference to a DOM node: class CustomTextInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    // create a ref to store the textInput DOM element
    this.textInput = React.createRef();
    this.focusTextInput = this.focusTextInput.bind(this);
  }
  focusTextInput() {
    // Explicitly focus the text input using the raw DOM API
    // Note: we're accessing "current" to get the DOM node
    this.textInput.current.focus();
  }
  render() {
    // tell React that we want to associate the <input> ref
    // with the `textInput` that we created in the constructor
    return (
      <div>
        <input
          type="text"
          ref={this.textInput} />        <input
          type="button"
          value="Focus the text input"
          onClick={this.focusTextInput}
        />
      </div>
    );
  }
} React will assign the current property with the DOM element when the component mounts, and assign it back to null when it unmounts. ref updates happen before componentDidMount or componentDidUpdate lifecycle methods. Adding a Ref to a Class Component  If we wanted to wrap the CustomTextInput above to simulate it being clicked immediately after mounting, we could use a ref to get access to the custom input and call its focusTextInput method manually: class AutoFocusTextInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.textInput = React.createRef();
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    this.textInput.current.focusTextInput();
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <CustomTextInput ref={this.textInput} />
    );
  }
} Note that this only works if CustomTextInput is declared as a class: class CustomTextInput extends React.Component {
  // ...
} Refs and Function Components  By default, you may not use the ref attribute on function components because they don’t have instances: function MyFunctionComponent() {
  return <input />;
}
class Parent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.textInput = React.createRef();
  }
  render() {
    // This will *not* work!
    return (
      <MyFunctionComponent ref={this.textInput} />
    );
  }
} If you want to allow people to take a ref to your function component, you can use forwardRef (possibly in conjunction with useImperativeHandle), or you can convert the component to a class. You can, however, use the ref attribute inside a function component as long as you refer to a DOM element or a class component: function CustomTextInput(props) {
  // textInput must be declared here so the ref can refer to it
  const textInput = useRef(null);
  
  function handleClick() {
    textInput.current.focus();
  }
  return (
    <div>
      <input
        type="text"
        ref={textInput} />      <input
        type="button"
        value="Focus the text input"
        onClick={handleClick}
      />
    </div>
  );
} Exposing DOM Refs to Parent Components  In rare cases, you might want to have access to a child’s DOM node from a parent component. This is generally not recommended because it breaks component encapsulation, but it can occasionally be useful for triggering focus or measuring the size or position of a child DOM node. While you could add a ref to the child component, this is not an ideal solution, as you would only get a component instance rather than a DOM node. Additionally, this wouldn’t work with function components. If you use React 16.3 or higher, we recommend to use ref forwarding for these cases. Ref forwarding lets components opt into exposing any child component’s ref as their own. You can find a detailed example of how to expose a child’s DOM node to a parent component in the ref forwarding documentation. If you use React 16.2 or lower, or if you need more flexibility than provided by ref forwarding, you can use this alternative approach and explicitly pass a ref as a differently named prop. When possible, we advise against exposing DOM nodes, but it can be a useful escape hatch. Note that this approach requires you to add some code to the child component. If you have absolutely no control over the child component implementation, your last option is to use findDOMNode(), but it is discouraged and deprecated in StrictMode. Callback Refs  React also supports another way to set refs called “callback refs”, which gives more fine-grain control over when refs are set and unset. Instead of passing a ref attribute created by createRef(), you pass a function. The function receives the React component instance or HTML DOM element as its argument, which can be stored and accessed elsewhere.  The example below implements a common pattern: using the ref callback to store a reference to a DOM node in an instance property. class CustomTextInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.textInput = null;
    this.setTextInputRef = element => {
      this.textInput = element;
    };
    this.focusTextInput = () => {
      // Focus the text input using the raw DOM API
      if (this.textInput) this.textInput.focus();
    };
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    // autofocus the input on mount
    this.focusTextInput();
  }
  render() {
    // Use the `ref` callback to store a reference to the text input DOM
    // element in an instance field (for example, this.textInput).
    return (
      <div>
        <input
          type="text"
          ref={this.setTextInputRef}        />
        <input
          type="button"
          value="Focus the text input"
          onClick={this.focusTextInput}        />
      </div>
    );
  }
} React will call the ref callback with the DOM element when the component mounts, and call it with null when it unmounts. Refs are guaranteed to be up-to-date before componentDidMount or componentDidUpdate fires. You can pass callback refs between components like you can with object refs that were created with React.createRef(). function CustomTextInput(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <input ref={props.inputRef} />
    </div>
  );
}
class Parent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <CustomTextInput
        inputRef={el => this.inputElement = el}      />
    );
  }
} In the example above, Parent passes its ref callback as an inputRef prop to the CustomTextInput, and the CustomTextInput passes the same function as a special ref attribute to the <input>. As a result, this.inputElement in Parent will be set to the DOM node corresponding to the <input> element in the CustomTextInput. Legacy API: String Refs  If you worked with React before, you might be familiar with an older API where the ref attribute is a string, like "textInput", and the DOM node is accessed as this.refs.textInput. We advise against it because string refs have some issues, are considered legacy, and are likely to be removed in one of the future releases.   Note If you’re currently using this.refs.textInput to access refs, we recommend using either the callback pattern or the createRef API instead.  Caveats with callback refs  If the ref callback is defined as an inline function, it will get called twice during updates, first with null and then again with the DOM element. This is because a new instance of the function is created with each render, so React needs to clear the old ref and set up the new one. You can avoid this by defining the ref callback as a bound method on the class, but note that it shouldn’t matter in most cases.

release-channels
-----------------------------------------------------------
Release Channels
React relies on a thriving open source community to file bug reports, open pull requests, and submit RFCs. To encourage feedback we sometimes share special builds of React that include unreleased features.  This document will be most relevant to developers who work on frameworks, libraries, or developer tooling. Developers who use React primarily to build user-facing applications should not need to worry about our prerelease channels.  Each of React’s release channels is designed for a distinct use case:  
Latest is for stable, semver React releases. It’s what you get when you install React from npm. This is the channel you’re already using today. Use this for all user-facing React applications.
 
Next tracks the main branch of the React source code repository. Think of these as release candidates for the next minor semver release. Use this for integration testing between React and third party projects. 
Experimental includes experimental APIs and features that aren’t available in the stable releases. These also track the main branch, but with additional feature flags turned on. Use this to try out upcoming features before they are released.  All releases are published to npm, but only Latest uses semantic versioning. Prereleases (those in the Next and Experimental channels) have versions generated from a hash of their contents and the commit date, e.g. 0.0.0-68053d940-20210623 for Next and 0.0.0-experimental-68053d940-20210623 for Experimental. The only officially supported release channel for user-facing applications is Latest. Next and Experimental releases are provided for testing purposes only, and we provide no guarantees that behavior won’t change between releases. They do not follow the semver protocol that we use for releases from Latest. By publishing prereleases to the same registry that we use for stable releases, we are able to take advantage of the many tools that support the npm workflow, like unpkg and CodeSandbox. Latest Channel  Latest is the channel used for stable React releases. It corresponds to the latest tag on npm. It is the recommended channel for all React apps that are shipped to real users. If you’re not sure which channel you should use, it’s Latest. If you’re a React developer, this is what you’re already using. You can expect updates to Latest to be extremely stable. Versions follow the semantic versioning scheme. Learn more about our commitment to stability and incremental migration in our versioning policy. Next Channel  The Next channel is a prerelease channel that tracks the main branch of the React repository. We use prereleases in the Next channel as release candidates for the Latest channel. You can think of Next as a superset of Latest that is updated more frequently. The degree of change between the most recent Next release and the most recent Latest release is approximately the same as you would find between two minor semver releases. However, the Next channel does not conform to semantic versioning. You should expect occasional breaking changes between successive releases in the Next channel. Do not use prereleases in user-facing applications. Releases in Next are published with the next tag on npm. Versions are generated from a hash of the build’s contents and the commit date, e.g. 0.0.0-68053d940-20210623. Using the Next Channel for Integration Testing  The Next channel is designed to support integration testing between React and other projects. All changes to React go through extensive internal testing before they are released to the public. However, there are a myriad of environments and configurations used throughout the React ecosystem, and it’s not possible for us to test against every single one. If you’re the author of a third party React framework, library, developer tool, or similar infrastructure-type project, you can help us keep React stable for your users and the entire React community by periodically running your test suite against the most recent changes. If you’re interested, follow these steps:  Set up a cron job using your preferred continuous integration platform. Cron jobs are supported by both CircleCI and Travis CI.  In the cron job, update your React packages to the most recent React release in the Next channel, using next tag on npm. Using the npm cli: npm update react@next react-dom@next Or yarn: yarn upgrade react@next react-dom@next  Run your test suite against the updated packages. If everything passes, great! You can expect that your project will work with the next minor React release. If something breaks unexpectedly, please let us know by filing an issue.  A project that uses this workflow is Next.js. (No pun intended! Seriously!) You can refer to their CircleCI configuration as an example. Experimental Channel  Like Next, the Experimental channel is a prerelease channel that tracks the main branch of the React repository. Unlike Next, Experimental releases include additional features and APIs that are not ready for wider release. Usually, an update to Next is accompanied by a corresponding update to Experimental. They are based on the same source revision, but are built using a different set of feature flags. Experimental releases may be significantly different than releases to Next and Latest. Do not use Experimental releases in user-facing applications. You should expect frequent breaking changes between releases in the Experimental channel. Releases in Experimental are published with the experimental tag on npm. Versions are generated from a hash of the build’s contents and the commit date, e.g. 0.0.0-experimental-68053d940-20210623. What Goes Into an Experimental Release?  Experimental features are ones that are not ready to be released to the wider public, and may change drastically before they are finalized. Some experiments may never be finalized — the reason we have experiments is to test the viability of proposed changes. For example, if the Experimental channel had existed when we announced Hooks, we would have released Hooks to the Experimental channel weeks before they were available in Latest. You may find it valuable to run integration tests against Experimental. This is up to you. However, be advised that Experimental is even less stable than Next. We do not guarantee any stability between Experimental releases. How Can I Learn More About Experimental Features?  Experimental features may or may not be documented. Usually, experiments aren’t documented until they are close to shipping in Next or Latest. If a feature is not documented, they may be accompanied by an RFC. We will post to the React blog when we’re ready to announce new experiments, but that doesn’t mean we will publicize every experiment. You can always refer to our public GitHub repository’s history for a comprehensive list of changes.

rendering-elements
-----------------------------------------------------------
Rendering Elements
Elements are the smallest building blocks of React apps. An element describes what you want to see on the screen: const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>; Unlike browser DOM elements, React elements are plain objects, and are cheap to create. React DOM takes care of updating the DOM to match the React elements.  Note: One might confuse elements with a more widely known concept of “components”. We will introduce components in the next section. Elements are what components are “made of”, and we encourage you to read this section before jumping ahead.  Rendering an Element into the DOM  Let’s say there is a <div> somewhere in your HTML file: <div id="root"></div> We call this a “root” DOM node because everything inside it will be managed by React DOM. Applications built with just React usually have a single root DOM node. If you are integrating React into an existing app, you may have as many isolated root DOM nodes as you like. To render a React element into a root DOM node, pass both to ReactDOM.render():
const element = <h1>Hello, world</h1>;
ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root')); Try it on CodePen It displays “Hello, world” on the page. Updating the Rendered Element  React elements are immutable. Once you create an element, you can’t change its children or attributes. An element is like a single frame in a movie: it represents the UI at a certain point in time. With our knowledge so far, the only way to update the UI is to create a new element, and pass it to ReactDOM.render(). Consider this ticking clock example:
function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(element, document.getElementById('root'));
}
setInterval(tick, 1000); Try it on CodePen It calls ReactDOM.render() every second from a setInterval() callback.  Note: In practice, most React apps only call ReactDOM.render() once. In the next sections we will learn how such code gets encapsulated into stateful components. We recommend that you don’t skip topics because they build on each other.  React Only Updates What’s Necessary  React DOM compares the element and its children to the previous one, and only applies the DOM updates necessary to bring the DOM to the desired state. You can verify by inspecting the last example with the browser tools:  Even though we create an element describing the whole UI tree on every tick, only the text node whose contents have changed gets updated by React DOM. In our experience, thinking about how the UI should look at any given moment, rather than how to change it over time, eliminates a whole class of bugs.

render-props
-----------------------------------------------------------
Render Props
The term “render prop” refers to a technique for sharing code between React components using a prop whose value is a function. A component with a render prop takes a function that returns a React element and calls it instead of implementing its own render logic. <DataProvider render={data => (
  <h1>Hello {data.target}</h1>
)}/> Libraries that use render props include React Router, Downshift and Formik. In this document, we’ll discuss why render props are useful, and how to write your own. Use Render Props for Cross-Cutting Concerns  Components are the primary unit of code reuse in React, but it’s not always obvious how to share the state or behavior that one component encapsulates to other components that need that same state. For example, the following component tracks the mouse position in a web app: class MouseTracker extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleMouseMove = this.handleMouseMove.bind(this);
    this.state = { x: 0, y: 0 };
  }
  handleMouseMove(event) {
    this.setState({
      x: event.clientX,
      y: event.clientY
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div style={{ height: '100vh' }} onMouseMove={this.handleMouseMove}>
        <h1>Move the mouse around!</h1>
        <p>The current mouse position is ({this.state.x}, {this.state.y})</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
} As the cursor moves around the screen, the component displays its (x, y) coordinates in a <p>. Now the question is: How can we reuse this behavior in another component? In other words, if another component needs to know about the cursor position, can we encapsulate that behavior so that we can easily share it with that component? Since components are the basic unit of code reuse in React, let’s try refactoring the code a bit to use a <Mouse> component that encapsulates the behavior we need to reuse elsewhere. // The <Mouse> component encapsulates the behavior we need...
class Mouse extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleMouseMove = this.handleMouseMove.bind(this);
    this.state = { x: 0, y: 0 };
  }
  handleMouseMove(event) {
    this.setState({
      x: event.clientX,
      y: event.clientY
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div style={{ height: '100vh' }} onMouseMove={this.handleMouseMove}>
        {/* ...but how do we render something other than a <p>? */}
        <p>The current mouse position is ({this.state.x}, {this.state.y})</p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
class MouseTracker extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <>
        <h1>Move the mouse around!</h1>
        <Mouse />
      </>
    );
  }
} Now the <Mouse> component encapsulates all behavior associated with listening for mousemove events and storing the (x, y) position of the cursor, but it’s not yet truly reusable. For example, let’s say we have a <Cat> component that renders the image of a cat chasing the mouse around the screen. We might use a <Cat mouse={{ x, y }}> prop to tell the component the coordinates of the mouse so it knows where to position the image on the screen. As a first pass, you might try rendering the <Cat> inside <Mouse>’s render method, like this: class Cat extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const mouse = this.props.mouse;
    return (
      <img src="/cat.jpg" style={{ position: 'absolute', left: mouse.x, top: mouse.y }} />
    );
  }
}
class MouseWithCat extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleMouseMove = this.handleMouseMove.bind(this);
    this.state = { x: 0, y: 0 };
  }
  handleMouseMove(event) {
    this.setState({
      x: event.clientX,
      y: event.clientY
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div style={{ height: '100vh' }} onMouseMove={this.handleMouseMove}>
        {/*
          We could just swap out the <p> for a <Cat> here ... but then
          we would need to create a separate <MouseWithSomethingElse>
          component every time we need to use it, so <MouseWithCat>
          isn't really reusable yet.
        */}
        <Cat mouse={this.state} />
      </div>
    );
  }
}
class MouseTracker extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Move the mouse around!</h1>
        <MouseWithCat />
      </div>
    );
  }
} This approach will work for our specific use case, but we haven’t achieved the objective of truly encapsulating the behavior in a reusable way. Now, every time we want the mouse position for a different use case, we have to create a new component (i.e. essentially another <MouseWithCat>) that renders something specifically for that use case. Here’s where the render prop comes in: Instead of hard-coding a <Cat> inside a <Mouse> component, and effectively changing its rendered output, we can provide <Mouse> with a function prop that it uses to dynamically determine what to render–a render prop. class Cat extends React.Component {
  render() {
    const mouse = this.props.mouse;
    return (
      <img src="/cat.jpg" style={{ position: 'absolute', left: mouse.x, top: mouse.y }} />
    );
  }
}
class Mouse extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleMouseMove = this.handleMouseMove.bind(this);
    this.state = { x: 0, y: 0 };
  }
  handleMouseMove(event) {
    this.setState({
      x: event.clientX,
      y: event.clientY
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div style={{ height: '100vh' }} onMouseMove={this.handleMouseMove}>
        {/*
          Instead of providing a static representation of what <Mouse> renders,
          use the `render` prop to dynamically determine what to render.
        */}
        {this.props.render(this.state)}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
class MouseTracker extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Move the mouse around!</h1>
        <Mouse render={mouse => (
          <Cat mouse={mouse} />
        )}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
} Now, instead of effectively cloning the <Mouse> component and hard-coding something else in its render method to solve for a specific use case, we provide a render prop that <Mouse> can use to dynamically determine what it renders. More concretely, a render prop is a function prop that a component uses to know what to render. This technique makes the behavior that we need to share extremely portable. To get that behavior, render a <Mouse> with a render prop that tells it what to render with the current (x, y) of the cursor. One interesting thing to note about render props is that you can implement most higher-order components (HOC) using a regular component with a render prop. For example, if you would prefer to have a withMouse HOC instead of a <Mouse> component, you could easily create one using a regular <Mouse> with a render prop: // If you really want a HOC for some reason, you can easily
// create one using a regular component with a render prop!
function withMouse(Component) {
  return class extends React.Component {
    render() {
      return (
        <Mouse render={mouse => (
          <Component {...this.props} mouse={mouse} />
        )}/>
      );
    }
  }
} So using a render prop makes it possible to use either pattern. Using Props Other Than render  It’s important to remember that just because the pattern is called “render props” you don’t have to use a prop named render to use this pattern. In fact, any prop that is a function that a component uses to know what to render is technically a “render prop”. Although the examples above use render, we could just as easily use the children prop! <Mouse children={mouse => (
  <p>The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}</p>
)}/> And remember, the children prop doesn’t actually need to be named in the list of “attributes” in your JSX element. Instead, you can put it directly inside the element! <Mouse>
  {mouse => (
    <p>The mouse position is {mouse.x}, {mouse.y}</p>
  )}
</Mouse> You’ll see this technique used in the react-motion API. Since this technique is a little unusual, you’ll probably want to explicitly state that children should be a function in your propTypes when designing an API like this. Mouse.propTypes = {
  children: PropTypes.func.isRequired
}; Caveats  Be careful when using Render Props with React.PureComponent  Using a render prop can negate the advantage that comes from using React.PureComponent if you create the function inside a render method. This is because the shallow prop comparison will always return false for new props, and each render in this case will generate a new value for the render prop. For example, continuing with our <Mouse> component from above, if Mouse were to extend React.PureComponent instead of React.Component, our example would look like this: class Mouse extends React.PureComponent {
  // Same implementation as above...
}
class MouseTracker extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Move the mouse around!</h1>
        {/*
          This is bad! The value of the `render` prop will
          be different on each render.
        */}
        <Mouse render={mouse => (
          <Cat mouse={mouse} />
        )}/>
      </div>
    );
  }
} In this example, each time <MouseTracker> renders, it generates a new function as the value of the <Mouse render> prop, thus negating the effect of <Mouse> extending React.PureComponent in the first place! To get around this problem, you can sometimes define the prop as an instance method, like so: class MouseTracker extends React.Component {
  // Defined as an instance method, `this.renderTheCat` always
  // refers to *same* function when we use it in render
  renderTheCat(mouse) {
    return <Cat mouse={mouse} />;
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Move the mouse around!</h1>
        <Mouse render={this.renderTheCat} />
      </div>
    );
  }
} In cases where you cannot define the prop statically (e.g. because you need to close over the component’s props and/or state) <Mouse> should extend React.Component instead.

state-and-lifecycle
-----------------------------------------------------------
State and Lifecycle
This page introduces the concept of state and lifecycle in a React component. You can find a detailed component API reference here. Consider the ticking clock example from one of the previous sections. In Rendering Elements, we have only learned one way to update the UI. We call ReactDOM.render() to change the rendered output: function tick() {
  const element = (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {new Date().toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
  ReactDOM.render(
    element,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
}
setInterval(tick, 1000); Try it on CodePen In this section, we will learn how to make the Clock component truly reusable and encapsulated. It will set up its own timer and update itself every second. We can start by encapsulating how the clock looks: function Clock(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
      <h2>It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
    </div>
  );
}
function tick() {
  ReactDOM.render(
    <Clock date={new Date()} />,
    document.getElementById('root')
  );
}
setInterval(tick, 1000); Try it on CodePen However, it misses a crucial requirement: the fact that the Clock sets up a timer and updates the UI every second should be an implementation detail of the Clock. Ideally we want to write this once and have the Clock update itself: ReactDOM.render(
  <Clock />,
  document.getElementById('root')
); To implement this, we need to add “state” to the Clock component. State is similar to props, but it is private and fully controlled by the component. Converting a Function to a Class  You can convert a function component like Clock to a class in five steps:  Create an ES6 class, with the same name, that extends React.Component. Add a single empty method to it called render(). Move the body of the function into the render() method. Replace props with this.props in the render() body. Delete the remaining empty function declaration.  class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
} Try it on CodePen Clock is now defined as a class rather than a function. The render method will be called each time an update happens, but as long as we render <Clock /> into the same DOM node, only a single instance of the Clock class will be used. This lets us use additional features such as local state and lifecycle methods. Adding Local State to a Class  We will move the date from props to state in three steps:  Replace this.props.date with this.state.date in the render() method:  class Clock extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}  Add a class constructor that assigns the initial this.state:  class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
} Note how we pass props to the base constructor:   constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  } Class components should always call the base constructor with props.  Remove the date prop from the <Clock /> element:  ReactDOM.render(
  <Clock />,
  document.getElementById('root')
); We will later add the timer code back to the component itself. The result looks like this: class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(
  <Clock />,
  document.getElementById('root')
); Try it on CodePen Next, we’ll make the Clock set up its own timer and update itself every second. Adding Lifecycle Methods to a Class  In applications with many components, it’s very important to free up resources taken by the components when they are destroyed. We want to set up a timer whenever the Clock is rendered to the DOM for the first time. This is called “mounting” in React. We also want to clear that timer whenever the DOM produced by the Clock is removed. This is called “unmounting” in React. We can declare special methods on the component class to run some code when a component mounts and unmounts: class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }
  componentDidMount() {
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
} These methods are called “lifecycle methods”. The componentDidMount() method runs after the component output has been rendered to the DOM. This is a good place to set up a timer:   componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(
      () => this.tick(),
      1000
    );
  } Note how we save the timer ID right on this (this.timerID). While this.props is set up by React itself and this.state has a special meaning, you are free to add additional fields to the class manually if you need to store something that doesn’t participate in the data flow (like a timer ID). We will tear down the timer in the componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method:   componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);
  } Finally, we will implement a method called tick() that the Clock component will run every second. It will use this.setState() to schedule updates to the component local state: class Clock extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {date: new Date()};
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    this.timerID = setInterval(
      () => this.tick(),
      1000
    );
  }
  componentWillUnmount() {
    clearInterval(this.timerID);
  }
  tick() {
    this.setState({
      date: new Date()
    });
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>Hello, world!</h1>
        <h2>It is {this.state.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>
      </div>
    );
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(
  <Clock />,
  document.getElementById('root')
); Try it on CodePen Now the clock ticks every second. Let’s quickly recap what’s going on and the order in which the methods are called:  When <Clock /> is passed to ReactDOM.render(), React calls the constructor of the Clock component. Since Clock needs to display the current time, it initializes this.state with an object including the current time. We will later update this state. React then calls the Clock component’s render() method. This is how React learns what should be displayed on the screen. React then updates the DOM to match the Clock’s render output. When the Clock output is inserted in the DOM, React calls the componentDidMount() lifecycle method. Inside it, the Clock component asks the browser to set up a timer to call the component’s tick() method once a second. Every second the browser calls the tick() method. Inside it, the Clock component schedules a UI update by calling setState() with an object containing the current time. Thanks to the setState() call, React knows the state has changed, and calls the render() method again to learn what should be on the screen. This time, this.state.date in the render() method will be different, and so the render output will include the updated time. React updates the DOM accordingly. If the Clock component is ever removed from the DOM, React calls the componentWillUnmount() lifecycle method so the timer is stopped.  Using State Correctly  There are three things you should know about setState(). Do Not Modify State Directly  For example, this will not re-render a component: // Wrong
this.state.comment = 'Hello'; Instead, use setState(): // Correct
this.setState({comment: 'Hello'}); The only place where you can assign this.state is the constructor. State Updates May Be Asynchronous  React may batch multiple setState() calls into a single update for performance. Because this.props and this.state may be updated asynchronously, you should not rely on their values for calculating the next state. For example, this code may fail to update the counter: // Wrong
this.setState({
  counter: this.state.counter + this.props.increment,
}); To fix it, use a second form of setState() that accepts a function rather than an object. That function will receive the previous state as the first argument, and the props at the time the update is applied as the second argument: // Correct
this.setState((state, props) => ({
  counter: state.counter + props.increment
})); We used an arrow function above, but it also works with regular functions: // Correct
this.setState(function(state, props) {
  return {
    counter: state.counter + props.increment
  };
}); State Updates are Merged  When you call setState(), React merges the object you provide into the current state. For example, your state may contain several independent variables:   constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      posts: [],
      comments: []
    };
  } Then you can update them independently with separate setState() calls:   componentDidMount() {
    fetchPosts().then(response => {
      this.setState({
        posts: response.posts
      });
    });
    fetchComments().then(response => {
      this.setState({
        comments: response.comments
      });
    });
  } The merging is shallow, so this.setState({comments}) leaves this.state.posts intact, but completely replaces this.state.comments. The Data Flows Down  Neither parent nor child components can know if a certain component is stateful or stateless, and they shouldn’t care whether it is defined as a function or a class. This is why state is often called local or encapsulated. It is not accessible to any component other than the one that owns and sets it. A component may choose to pass its state down as props to its child components: <FormattedDate date={this.state.date} /> The FormattedDate component would receive the date in its props and wouldn’t know whether it came from the Clock’s state, from the Clock’s props, or was typed by hand: function FormattedDate(props) {
  return <h2>It is {props.date.toLocaleTimeString()}.</h2>;
} Try it on CodePen This is commonly called a “top-down” or “unidirectional” data flow. Any state is always owned by some specific component, and any data or UI derived from that state can only affect components “below” them in the tree. If you imagine a component tree as a waterfall of props, each component’s state is like an additional water source that joins it at an arbitrary point but also flows down. To show that all components are truly isolated, we can create an App component that renders three <Clock>s: function App() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Clock />
      <Clock />
      <Clock />
    </div>
  );
}
ReactDOM.render(
  <App />,
  document.getElementById('root')
); Try it on CodePen Each Clock sets up its own timer and updates independently. In React apps, whether a component is stateful or stateless is considered an implementation detail of the component that may change over time. You can use stateless components inside stateful components, and vice versa.

static-type-checking
-----------------------------------------------------------
Static Type Checking
Static type checkers like Flow and TypeScript identify certain types of problems before you even run your code. They can also improve developer workflow by adding features like auto-completion. For this reason, we recommend using Flow or TypeScript instead of PropTypes for larger code bases. Flow  Flow is a static type checker for your JavaScript code. It is developed at Facebook and is often used with React. It lets you annotate the variables, functions, and React components with a special type syntax, and catch mistakes early. You can read an introduction to Flow to learn its basics. To use Flow, you need to:  Add Flow to your project as a dependency. Ensure that Flow syntax is stripped from the compiled code. Add type annotations and run Flow to check them.  We will explain these steps below in detail. Adding Flow to a Project  First, navigate to your project directory in the terminal. You will need to run the following command: If you use Yarn, run: yarn add --dev flow-bin If you use npm, run: npm install --save-dev flow-bin This command installs the latest version of Flow into your project. Now, add flow to the "scripts" section of your package.json to be able to use this from the terminal: {
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "flow": "flow",
    // ...
  },
  // ...
} Finally, run one of the following commands: If you use Yarn, run: yarn run flow init If you use npm, run: npm run flow init This command will create a Flow configuration file that you will need to commit. Stripping Flow Syntax from the Compiled Code  Flow extends the JavaScript language with a special syntax for type annotations. However, browsers aren’t aware of this syntax, so we need to make sure it doesn’t end up in the compiled JavaScript bundle that is sent to the browser. The exact way to do this depends on the tools you use to compile JavaScript. Create React App  If your project was set up using Create React App, congratulations! The Flow annotations are already being stripped by default so you don’t need to do anything else in this step. Babel   Note: These instructions are not for Create React App users. Even though Create React App uses Babel under the hood, it is already configured to understand Flow. Only follow this step if you don’t use Create React App.  If you manually configured Babel for your project, you will need to install a special preset for Flow. If you use Yarn, run: yarn add --dev @babel/preset-flow If you use npm, run: npm install --save-dev @babel/preset-flow Then add the flow preset to your Babel configuration. For example, if you configure Babel through .babelrc file, it could look like this: {
  "presets": [
    "@babel/preset-flow",
    "react"
  ]
} This will let you use the Flow syntax in your code.  Note: Flow does not require the react preset, but they are often used together. Flow itself understands JSX syntax out of the box.  Other Build Setups  If you don’t use either Create React App or Babel, you can use flow-remove-types to strip the type annotations. Running Flow  If you followed the instructions above, you should be able to run Flow for the first time. yarn flow If you use npm, run: npm run flow You should see a message like: No errors!
✨  Done in 0.17s. Adding Flow Type Annotations  By default, Flow only checks the files that include this annotation: // @flow Typically it is placed at the top of a file. Try adding it to some files in your project and run yarn flow or npm run flow to see if Flow already found any issues. There is also an option to force Flow to check all files regardless of the annotation. This can be too noisy for existing projects, but is reasonable for a new project if you want to fully type it with Flow. Now you’re all set! We recommend to check out the following resources to learn more about Flow:  Flow Documentation: Type Annotations Flow Documentation: Editors Flow Documentation: React Linting in Flow  TypeScript  TypeScript is a programming language developed by Microsoft. It is a typed superset of JavaScript, and includes its own compiler. Being a typed language, TypeScript can catch errors and bugs at build time, long before your app goes live. You can learn more about using TypeScript with React here. To use TypeScript, you need to:  Add TypeScript as a dependency to your project Configure the TypeScript compiler options Use the right file extensions Add definitions for libraries you use  Let’s go over these in detail. Using TypeScript with Create React App  Create React App supports TypeScript out of the box. To create a new project with TypeScript support, run: npx create-react-app my-app --template typescript You can also add it to an existing Create React App project, as documented here.  Note: If you use Create React App, you can skip the rest of this page. It describes the manual setup which doesn’t apply to Create React App users.  Adding TypeScript to a Project  It all begins with running one command in your terminal. If you use Yarn, run: yarn add --dev typescript If you use npm, run: npm install --save-dev typescript Congrats! You’ve installed the latest version of TypeScript into your project. Installing TypeScript gives us access to the tsc command. Before configuration, let’s add tsc to the “scripts” section in our package.json: {
  // ...
  "scripts": {
    "build": "tsc",
    // ...
  },
  // ...
} Configuring the TypeScript Compiler  The compiler is of no help to us until we tell it what to do. In TypeScript, these rules are defined in a special file called tsconfig.json. To generate this file: If you use Yarn, run: yarn run tsc --init If you use npm, run: npx tsc --init Looking at the now generated tsconfig.json, you can see that there are many options you can use to configure the compiler. For a detailed description of all the options, check here. Of the many options, we’ll look at rootDir and outDir. In its true fashion, the compiler will take in typescript files and generate javascript files. However we don’t want to get confused with our source files and the generated output. We’ll address this in two steps:  Firstly, let’s arrange our project structure like this. We’ll place all our source code in the src directory.  ├── package.json
├── src
│   └── index.ts
└── tsconfig.json  Next, we’ll tell the compiler where our source code is and where the output should go.  // tsconfig.json
{
  "compilerOptions": {
    // ...
    "rootDir": "src",
    "outDir": "build"
    // ...
  },
} Great! Now when we run our build script the compiler will output the generated javascript to the build folder. The TypeScript React Starter provides a tsconfig.json with a good set of rules to get you started. Generally, you don’t want to keep the generated javascript in your source control, so be sure to add the build folder to your .gitignore. File extensions  In React, you most likely write your components in a .js file. In TypeScript we have 2 file extensions: .ts is the default file extension while .tsx is a special extension used for files which contain JSX. Running TypeScript  If you followed the instructions above, you should be able to run TypeScript for the first time. yarn build If you use npm, run: npm run build If you see no output, it means that it completed successfully. Type Definitions  To be able to show errors and hints from other packages, the compiler relies on declaration files. A declaration file provides all the type information about a library. This enables us to use javascript libraries like those on npm in our project.  There are two main ways to get declarations for a library: Bundled - The library bundles its own declaration file. This is great for us, since all we need to do is install the library, and we can use it right away. To check if a library has bundled types, look for an index.d.ts file in the project. Some libraries will have it specified in their package.json under the typings or types field. DefinitelyTyped - DefinitelyTyped is a huge repository of declarations for libraries that don’t bundle a declaration file. The declarations are crowd-sourced and managed by Microsoft and open source contributors. React for example doesn’t bundle its own declaration file. Instead we can get it from DefinitelyTyped. To do so enter this command in your terminal. # yarn
yarn add --dev @types/react
# npm
npm i --save-dev @types/react Local Declarations Sometimes the package that you want to use doesn’t bundle declarations nor is it available on DefinitelyTyped. In that case, we can have a local declaration file. To do this, create a declarations.d.ts file in the root of your source directory. A simple declaration could look like this: declare module 'querystring' {
  export function stringify(val: object): string
  export function parse(val: string): object
} You are now ready to code! We recommend to check out the following resources to learn more about TypeScript:  TypeScript Documentation: Everyday Types TypeScript Documentation: Migrating from JavaScript TypeScript Documentation: React and Webpack  ReScript  ReScript is a typed language that compiles to JavaScript. Some of its core features are guaranteed 100% type coverage, first-class JSX support and dedicated React bindings to allow integration in existing JS / TS React codebases. You can find more infos on integrating ReScript in your existing JS / React codebase here. Kotlin  Kotlin is a statically typed language developed by JetBrains. Its target platforms include the JVM, Android, LLVM, and JavaScript.  JetBrains develops and maintains several tools specifically for the React community: React bindings as well as Create React Kotlin App. The latter helps you start building React apps with Kotlin with no build configuration. Other Languages  Note there are other statically typed languages that compile to JavaScript and are thus React compatible. For example, F#/Fable with elmish-react. Check out their respective sites for more information, and feel free to add more statically typed languages that work with React to this page!

strict-mode
-----------------------------------------------------------
Strict Mode
StrictMode is a tool for highlighting potential problems in an application. Like Fragment, StrictMode does not render any visible UI. It activates additional checks and warnings for its descendants.  Note: Strict mode checks are run in development mode only; they do not impact the production build.  You can enable strict mode for any part of your application. For example: 
import React from 'react';
function ExampleApplication() {
  return (
    <div>
      <Header />
      <React.StrictMode>
        <div>
          <ComponentOne />
          <ComponentTwo />
        </div>
      </React.StrictMode>
      <Footer />
    </div>
  );
} In the above example, strict mode checks will not be run against the Header and Footer components. However, ComponentOne and ComponentTwo, as well as all of their descendants, will have the checks. StrictMode currently helps with:  Identifying components with unsafe lifecycles Warning about legacy string ref API usage Warning about deprecated findDOMNode usage Detecting unexpected side effects Detecting legacy context API  Additional functionality will be added with future releases of React. Identifying unsafe lifecycles  As explained in this blog post, certain legacy lifecycle methods are unsafe for use in async React applications. However, if your application uses third party libraries, it can be difficult to ensure that these lifecycles aren’t being used. Fortunately, strict mode can help with this! When strict mode is enabled, React compiles a list of all class components using the unsafe lifecycles, and logs a warning message with information about these components, like so:      Addressing the issues identified by strict mode now will make it easier for you to take advantage of concurrent rendering in future releases of React. Warning about legacy string ref API usage  Previously, React provided two ways for managing refs: the legacy string ref API and the callback API. Although the string ref API was the more convenient of the two, it had several downsides and so our official recommendation was to use the callback form instead. React 16.3 added a third option that offers the convenience of a string ref without any of the downsides: 
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.inputRef = React.createRef();
  }
  render() {
    return <input type="text" ref={this.inputRef} />;
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    this.inputRef.current.focus();
  }
} Since object refs were largely added as a replacement for string refs, strict mode now warns about usage of string refs.  Note: Callback refs will continue to be supported in addition to the new createRef API. You don’t need to replace callback refs in your components. They are slightly more flexible, so they will remain as an advanced feature.  Learn more about the new createRef API here. Warning about deprecated findDOMNode usage  React used to support findDOMNode to search the tree for a DOM node given a class instance. Normally you don’t need this because you can attach a ref directly to a DOM node. findDOMNode can also be used on class components but this was breaking abstraction levels by allowing a parent to demand that certain children were rendered. It creates a refactoring hazard where you can’t change the implementation details of a component because a parent might be reaching into its DOM node. findDOMNode only returns the first child, but with the use of Fragments, it is possible for a component to render multiple DOM nodes. findDOMNode is a one time read API. It only gave you an answer when you asked for it. If a child component renders a different node, there is no way to handle this change. Therefore findDOMNode only worked if components always return a single DOM node that never changes. You can instead make this explicit by passing a ref to your custom component and pass that along to the DOM using ref forwarding. You can also add a wrapper DOM node in your component and attach a ref directly to it. class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.wrapper = React.createRef();
  }
  render() {
    return <div ref={this.wrapper}>{this.props.children}</div>;
  }
}  Note: In CSS, the display: contents attribute can be used if you don’t want the node to be part of the layout.  Detecting unexpected side effects  Conceptually, React does work in two phases:  The render phase determines what changes need to be made to e.g. the DOM. During this phase, React calls render and then compares the result to the previous render. The commit phase is when React applies any changes. (In the case of React DOM, this is when React inserts, updates, and removes DOM nodes.) React also calls lifecycles like componentDidMount and componentDidUpdate during this phase.  The commit phase is usually very fast, but rendering can be slow. For this reason, the upcoming concurrent mode (which is not enabled by default yet) breaks the rendering work into pieces, pausing and resuming the work to avoid blocking the browser. This means that React may invoke render phase lifecycles more than once before committing, or it may invoke them without committing at all (because of an error or a higher priority interruption). Render phase lifecycles include the following class component methods:  constructor 
componentWillMount (or UNSAFE_componentWillMount) 
componentWillReceiveProps (or UNSAFE_componentWillReceiveProps) 
componentWillUpdate (or UNSAFE_componentWillUpdate) getDerivedStateFromProps shouldComponentUpdate render 
setState updater functions (the first argument)  Because the above methods might be called more than once, it’s important that they do not contain side-effects. Ignoring this rule can lead to a variety of problems, including memory leaks and invalid application state. Unfortunately, it can be difficult to detect these problems as they can often be non-deterministic. Strict mode can’t automatically detect side effects for you, but it can help you spot them by making them a little more deterministic. This is done by intentionally double-invoking the following functions:  Class component constructor, render, and shouldComponentUpdate methods Class component static getDerivedStateFromProps method Function component bodies State updater functions (the first argument to setState) Functions passed to useState, useMemo, or useReducer
   Note: This only applies to development mode. Lifecycles will not be double-invoked in production mode.  For example, consider the following code: 
class TopLevelRoute extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    SharedApplicationState.recordEvent('ExampleComponent');
  }
} At first glance, this code might not seem problematic. But if SharedApplicationState.recordEvent is not idempotent, then instantiating this component multiple times could lead to invalid application state. This sort of subtle bug might not manifest during development, or it might do so inconsistently and so be overlooked. By intentionally double-invoking methods like the component constructor, strict mode makes patterns like this easier to spot.  Note: Starting with React 17, React automatically modifies the console methods like console.log() to silence the logs in the second call to lifecycle functions. However, it may cause undesired behavior in certain cases where a workaround can be used.  Detecting legacy context API  The legacy context API is error-prone, and will be removed in a future major version. It still works for all 16.x releases but will show this warning message in strict mode:      Read the new context API documentation to help migrate to the new version.

testing
-----------------------------------------------------------
Testing Overview
You can test React components similar to testing other JavaScript code. There are a few ways to test React components. Broadly, they divide into two categories:  
Rendering component trees in a simplified test environment and asserting on their output. 
Running a complete app in a realistic browser environment (also known as “end-to-end” tests).  This documentation section focuses on testing strategies for the first case. While full end-to-end tests can be very useful to prevent regressions to important workflows, such tests are not concerned with React components in particular, and are out of the scope of this section. Tradeoffs  When choosing testing tools, it is worth considering a few tradeoffs:  
Iteration speed vs Realistic environment: Some tools offer a very quick feedback loop between making a change and seeing the result, but don’t model the browser behavior precisely. Other tools might use a real browser environment, but reduce the iteration speed and are flakier on a continuous integration server. 
How much to mock: With components, the distinction between a “unit” and “integration” test can be blurry. If you’re testing a form, should its test also test the buttons inside of it? Or should a button component have its own test suite? Should refactoring a button ever break the form test?  Different answers may work for different teams and products. Recommended Tools  Jest is a JavaScript test runner that lets you access the DOM via jsdom. While jsdom is only an approximation of how the browser works, it is often good enough for testing React components. Jest provides a great iteration speed combined with powerful features like mocking modules and timers so you can have more control over how the code executes. React Testing Library is a set of helpers that let you test React components without relying on their implementation details. This approach makes refactoring a breeze and also nudges you towards best practices for accessibility. Although it doesn’t provide a way to “shallowly” render a component without its children, a test runner like Jest lets you do this by mocking. Learn More  This section is divided in two pages:  
Recipes: Common patterns when writing tests for React components. 
Environments: What to consider when setting up a testing environment for React components.

testing-environments
-----------------------------------------------------------
Testing Environments This document goes through the factors that can affect your environment and recommendations for some scenarios. Test runners  Test runners like Jest, mocha, ava let you write test suites as regular JavaScript, and run them as part of your development process. Additionally, test suites are run as part of continuous integration.  Jest is widely compatible with React projects, supporting features like mocked modules and timers, and jsdom support. If you use Create React App, Jest is already included out of the box with useful defaults.
 Libraries like mocha work well in real browser environments, and could help for tests that explicitly need it. End-to-end tests are used for testing longer flows across multiple pages, and require a different setup.  Mocking a rendering surface  Tests often run in an environment without access to a real rendering surface like a browser. For these environments, we recommend simulating a browser with jsdom, a lightweight browser implementation that runs inside Node.js. In most cases, jsdom behaves like a regular browser would, but doesn’t have features like layout and navigation. This is still useful for most web-based component tests, since it runs quicker than having to start up a browser for each test. It also runs in the same process as your tests, so you can write code to examine and assert on the rendered DOM. Just like in a real browser, jsdom lets us model user interactions; tests can dispatch events on DOM nodes, and then observe and assert on the side effects of these actions (example). A large portion of UI tests can be written with the above setup: using Jest as a test runner, rendered to jsdom, with user interactions specified as sequences of browser events, powered by the act() helper (example). For example, a lot of React’s own tests are written with this combination. If you’re writing a library that tests mostly browser-specific behavior, and requires native browser behavior like layout or real inputs, you could use a framework like mocha. In an environment where you can’t simulate a DOM (e.g. testing React Native components on Node.js), you could use event simulation helpers to simulate interactions with elements. Alternately, you could use the fireEvent helper from @testing-library/react-native. Frameworks like Cypress, puppeteer and webdriver are useful for running end-to-end tests. Mocking functions  When writing tests, we’d like to mock out the parts of our code that don’t have equivalents inside our testing environment (e.g. checking navigator.onLine status inside Node.js). Tests could also spy on some functions, and observe how other parts of the test interact with them. It is then useful to be able to selectively mock these functions with test-friendly versions. This is especially useful for data fetching. It is usually preferable to use “fake” data for tests to avoid the slowness and flakiness due to fetching from real API endpoints (example). This helps make the tests predictable. Libraries like Jest and sinon, among others, support mocked functions. For end-to-end tests, mocking network can be more difficult, but you might also want to test the real API endpoints in them anyway. Mocking modules  Some components have dependencies for modules that may not work well in test environments, or aren’t essential to our tests. It can be useful to selectively mock these modules out with suitable replacements (example). On Node.js, runners like Jest support mocking modules. You could also use libraries like mock-require. Mocking timers  Components might be using time-based functions like setTimeout, setInterval, or Date.now. In testing environments, it can be helpful to mock these functions out with replacements that let you manually “advance” time. This is great for making sure your tests run fast! Tests that are dependent on timers would still resolve in order, but quicker (example). Most frameworks, including Jest, sinon and lolex, let you mock timers in your tests. Sometimes, you may not want to mock timers. For example, maybe you’re testing an animation, or interacting with an endpoint that’s sensitive to timing (like an API rate limiter). Libraries with timer mocks let you enable and disable them on a per test/suite basis, so you can explicitly choose how these tests would run. End-to-end tests  End-to-end tests are useful for testing longer workflows, especially when they’re critical to your business (such as payments or signups). For these tests, you’d probably want to test how a real browser renders the whole app, fetches data from the real API endpoints, uses sessions and cookies, navigates between different links. You might also likely want to make assertions not just on the DOM state, but on the backing data as well (e.g. to verify whether the updates have been persisted to the database). In this scenario, you would use a framework like Cypress, Playwright or a library like Puppeteer so you can navigate between multiple routes and assert on side effects not just in the browser, but potentially on the backend as well.

testing-recipes
-----------------------------------------------------------
Testing Recipes
Common testing patterns for React components.  Note: This page assumes you’re using Jest as a test runner. If you use a different test runner, you may need to adjust the API, but the overall shape of the solution will likely be the same. Read more details on setting up a testing environment on the Testing Environments page.  On this page, we will primarily use function components. However, these testing strategies don’t depend on implementation details, and work just as well for class components too.  Setup/Teardown act() Rendering Data Fetching Mocking Modules Events Timers Snapshot Testing Multiple Renderers Something Missing?  Setup/Teardown  For each test, we usually want to render our React tree to a DOM element that’s attached to document. This is important so that it can receive DOM events. When the test ends, we want to “clean up” and unmount the tree from the document. A common way to do it is to use a pair of beforeEach and afterEach blocks so that they’ll always run and isolate the effects of a test to itself: import { unmountComponentAtNode } from "react-dom";
let container = null;
beforeEach(() => {
  // setup a DOM element as a render target
  container = document.createElement("div");
  document.body.appendChild(container);
});
afterEach(() => {
  // cleanup on exiting
  unmountComponentAtNode(container);
  container.remove();
  container = null;
}); You may use a different pattern, but keep in mind that we want to execute the cleanup even if a test fails. Otherwise, tests can become “leaky”, and one test can change the behavior of another test. That makes them difficult to debug. 
act()  When writing UI tests, tasks like rendering, user events, or data fetching can be considered as “units” of interaction with a user interface. react-dom/test-utils provides a helper called act() that makes sure all updates related to these “units” have been processed and applied to the DOM before you make any assertions: act(() => {
  // render components
});
// make assertions This helps make your tests run closer to what real users would experience when using your application. The rest of these examples use act() to make these guarantees. You might find using act() directly a bit too verbose. To avoid some of the boilerplate, you could use a library like React Testing Library, whose helpers are wrapped with act().  Note: The name act comes from the Arrange-Act-Assert pattern.  Rendering  Commonly, you might want to test whether a component renders correctly for given props. Consider a simple component that renders a message based on a prop: // hello.js
import React from "react";
export default function Hello(props) {
  if (props.name) {
    return <h1>Hello, {props.name}!</h1>;
  } else {
    return <span>Hey, stranger</span>;
  }
} We can write a test for this component: // hello.test.js
import React from "react";
import { render, unmountComponentAtNode } from "react-dom";
import { act } from "react-dom/test-utils";
import Hello from "./hello";
let container = null;
beforeEach(() => {
  // setup a DOM element as a render target
  container = document.createElement("div");
  document.body.appendChild(container);
});
afterEach(() => {
  // cleanup on exiting
  unmountComponentAtNode(container);
  container.remove();
  container = null;
});
it("renders with or without a name", () => {
  act(() => {
    render(<Hello />, container);
  });
  expect(container.textContent).toBe("Hey, stranger");
  act(() => {
    render(<Hello name="Jenny" />, container);
  });
  expect(container.textContent).toBe("Hello, Jenny!");
  act(() => {
    render(<Hello name="Margaret" />, container);
  });
  expect(container.textContent).toBe("Hello, Margaret!");
}); Data Fetching  Instead of calling real APIs in all your tests, you can mock requests with dummy data. Mocking data fetching with “fake” data prevents flaky tests due to an unavailable backend, and makes them run faster. Note: you may still want to run a subset of tests using an “end-to-end” framework that tells whether the whole app is working together. // user.js
import React, { useState, useEffect } from "react";
export default function User(props) {
  const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
  async function fetchUserData(id) {
    const response = await fetch("/" + id);
    setUser(await response.json());
  }
  useEffect(() => {
    fetchUserData(props.id);
  }, [props.id]);
  if (!user) {
    return "loading...";
  }
  return (
    <details>
      <summary>{user.name}</summary>
      <strong>{user.age}</strong> years old
      <br />
      lives in {user.address}
    </details>
  );
} We can write tests for it: // user.test.js
import React from "react";
import { render, unmountComponentAtNode } from "react-dom";
import { act } from "react-dom/test-utils";
import User from "./user";
let container = null;
beforeEach(() => {
  // setup a DOM element as a render target
  container = document.createElement("div");
  document.body.appendChild(container);
});
afterEach(() => {
  // cleanup on exiting
  unmountComponentAtNode(container);
  container.remove();
  container = null;
});
it("renders user data", async () => {
  const fakeUser = {
    name: "Joni Baez",
    age: "32",
    address: "123, Charming Avenue"
  };
  jest.spyOn(global, "fetch").mockImplementation(() =>
    Promise.resolve({
      json: () => Promise.resolve(fakeUser)
    })
  );
  // Use the asynchronous version of act to apply resolved promises
  await act(async () => {
    render(<User id="123" />, container);
  });
  expect(container.querySelector("summary").textContent).toBe(fakeUser.name);
  expect(container.querySelector("strong").textContent).toBe(fakeUser.age);
  expect(container.textContent).toContain(fakeUser.address);
  // remove the mock to ensure tests are completely isolated
  global.fetch.mockRestore();
}); Mocking Modules  Some modules might not work well inside a testing environment, or may not be as essential to the test itself. Mocking out these modules with dummy replacements can make it easier to write tests for your own code. Consider a Contact component that embeds a third-party GoogleMap component: // map.js
import React from "react";
import { LoadScript, GoogleMap } from "react-google-maps";
export default function Map(props) {
  return (
    <LoadScript id="script-loader" googleMapsApiKey="YOUR_API_KEY">
      <GoogleMap id="example-map" center={props.center} />
    </LoadScript>
  );
}
// contact.js
import React from "react";
import Map from "./map";
export default function Contact(props) {
  return (
    <div>
      <address>
        Contact {props.name} via{" "}
        <a data-testid="email" href={"mailto:" + props.email}>
          email
        </a>
        or on their <a data-testid="site" href={props.site}>
          website
        </a>.
      </address>
      <Map center={props.center} />
    </div>
  );
} If we don’t want to load this component in our tests, we can mock out the dependency itself to a dummy component, and run our tests: // contact.test.js
import React from "react";
import { render, unmountComponentAtNode } from "react-dom";
import { act } from "react-dom/test-utils";
import Contact from "./contact";
import MockedMap from "./map";
jest.mock("./map", () => {
  return function DummyMap(props) {
    return (
      <div data-testid="map">
        {props.center.lat}:{props.center.long}
      </div>
    );
  };
});
let container = null;
beforeEach(() => {
  // setup a DOM element as a render target
  container = document.createElement("div");
  document.body.appendChild(container);
});
afterEach(() => {
  // cleanup on exiting
  unmountComponentAtNode(container);
  container.remove();
  container = null;
});
it("should render contact information", () => {
  const center = { lat: 0, long: 0 };
  act(() => {
    render(
      <Contact
        name="Joni Baez"
        email="test@example.com"
        site="http://test.com"
        center={center}
      />,
      container
    );
  });
  expect(
    container.querySelector("[data-testid='email']").getAttribute("href")
  ).toEqual("mailto:test@example.com");
  expect(
    container.querySelector('[data-testid="site"]').getAttribute("href")
  ).toEqual("http://test.com");
  expect(container.querySelector('[data-testid="map"]').textContent).toEqual(
    "0:0"
  );
}); Events  We recommend dispatching real DOM events on DOM elements, and then asserting on the result. Consider a Toggle component: // toggle.js
import React, { useState } from "react";
export default function Toggle(props) {
  const [state, setState] = useState(false);
  return (
    <button
      onClick={() => {
        setState(previousState => !previousState);
        props.onChange(!state);
      }}
      data-testid="toggle"
    >
      {state === true ? "Turn off" : "Turn on"}
    </button>
  );
} We could write tests for it: // toggle.test.js
import React from "react";
import { render, unmountComponentAtNode } from "react-dom";
import { act } from "react-dom/test-utils";
import Toggle from "./toggle";
let container = null;
beforeEach(() => {
  // setup a DOM element as a render target
  container = document.createElement("div");
  document.body.appendChild(container);
});
afterEach(() => {
  // cleanup on exiting
  unmountComponentAtNode(container);
  container.remove();
  container = null;
});
it("changes value when clicked", () => {
  const onChange = jest.fn();
  act(() => {
    render(<Toggle onChange={onChange} />, container);
  });
  // get a hold of the button element, and trigger some clicks on it
  const button = document.querySelector("[data-testid=toggle]");
  expect(button.innerHTML).toBe("Turn on");
  act(() => {
    button.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent("click", { bubbles: true }));
  });
  expect(onChange).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(1);
  expect(button.innerHTML).toBe("Turn off");
  act(() => {
    for (let i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
      button.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent("click", { bubbles: true }));
    }
  });
  expect(onChange).toHaveBeenCalledTimes(6);
  expect(button.innerHTML).toBe("Turn on");
}); Different DOM events and their properties are described in MDN. Note that you need to pass { bubbles: true } in each event you create for it to reach the React listener because React automatically delegates events to the root.  Note: React Testing Library offers a more concise helper for firing events.  Timers  Your code might use timer-based functions like setTimeout to schedule more work in the future. In this example, a multiple choice panel waits for a selection and advances, timing out if a selection isn’t made in 5 seconds: // card.js
import React, { useEffect } from "react";
export default function Card(props) {
  useEffect(() => {
    const timeoutID = setTimeout(() => {
      props.onSelect(null);
    }, 5000);
    return () => {
      clearTimeout(timeoutID);
    };
  }, [props.onSelect]);
  return [1, 2, 3, 4].map(choice => (
    <button
      key={choice}
      data-testid={choice}
      onClick={() => props.onSelect(choice)}
    >
      {choice}
    </button>
  ));
} We can write tests for this component by leveraging Jest’s timer mocks, and testing the different states it can be in. // card.test.js
import React from "react";
import { render, unmountComponentAtNode } from "react-dom";
import { act } from "react-dom/test-utils";
import Card from "./card";
let container = null;
beforeEach(() => {
  // setup a DOM element as a render target
  container = document.createElement("div");
  document.body.appendChild(container);
  jest.useFakeTimers();
});
afterEach(() => {
  // cleanup on exiting
  unmountComponentAtNode(container);
  container.remove();
  container = null;
  jest.useRealTimers();
});
it("should select null after timing out", () => {
  const onSelect = jest.fn();
  act(() => {
    render(<Card onSelect={onSelect} />, container);
  });
  // move ahead in time by 100ms
  act(() => {
    jest.advanceTimersByTime(100);
  });
  expect(onSelect).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
  // and then move ahead by 5 seconds
  act(() => {
    jest.advanceTimersByTime(5000);
  });
  expect(onSelect).toHaveBeenCalledWith(null);
});
it("should cleanup on being removed", () => {
  const onSelect = jest.fn();
  act(() => {
    render(<Card onSelect={onSelect} />, container);
  });
  act(() => {
    jest.advanceTimersByTime(100);
  });
  expect(onSelect).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
  // unmount the app
  act(() => {
    render(null, container);
  });
  act(() => {
    jest.advanceTimersByTime(5000);
  });
  expect(onSelect).not.toHaveBeenCalled();
});
it("should accept selections", () => {
  const onSelect = jest.fn();
  act(() => {
    render(<Card onSelect={onSelect} />, container);
  });
  act(() => {
    container
      .querySelector("[data-testid='2']")
      .dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent("click", { bubbles: true }));
  });
  expect(onSelect).toHaveBeenCalledWith(2);
}); You can use fake timers only in some tests. Above, we enabled them by calling jest.useFakeTimers(). The main advantage they provide is that your test doesn’t actually have to wait five seconds to execute, and you also didn’t need to make the component code more convoluted just for testing. Snapshot Testing  Frameworks like Jest also let you save “snapshots” of data with toMatchSnapshot / toMatchInlineSnapshot. With these, we can “save” the rendered component output and ensure that a change to it has to be explicitly committed as a change to the snapshot. In this example, we render a component and format the rendered HTML with the pretty package, before saving it as an inline snapshot: // hello.test.js, again
import React from "react";
import { render, unmountComponentAtNode } from "react-dom";
import { act } from "react-dom/test-utils";
import pretty from "pretty";
import Hello from "./hello";
let container = null;
beforeEach(() => {
  // setup a DOM element as a render target
  container = document.createElement("div");
  document.body.appendChild(container);
});
afterEach(() => {
  // cleanup on exiting
  unmountComponentAtNode(container);
  container.remove();
  container = null;
});
it("should render a greeting", () => {
  act(() => {
    render(<Hello />, container);
  });
  expect(
    pretty(container.innerHTML)
  ).toMatchInlineSnapshot(); /* ... gets filled automatically by jest ... */
  act(() => {
    render(<Hello name="Jenny" />, container);
  });
  expect(
    pretty(container.innerHTML)
  ).toMatchInlineSnapshot(); /* ... gets filled automatically by jest ... */
  act(() => {
    render(<Hello name="Margaret" />, container);
  });
  expect(
    pretty(container.innerHTML)
  ).toMatchInlineSnapshot(); /* ... gets filled automatically by jest ... */
}); It’s typically better to make more specific assertions than to use snapshots. These kinds of tests include implementation details so they break easily, and teams can get desensitized to snapshot breakages. Selectively mocking some child components can help reduce the size of snapshots and keep them readable for the code review. Multiple Renderers  In rare cases, you may be running a test on a component that uses multiple renderers. For example, you may be running snapshot tests on a component with react-test-renderer, that internally uses ReactDOM.render inside a child component to render some content. In this scenario, you can wrap updates with act()s corresponding to their renderers. import { act as domAct } from "react-dom/test-utils";
import { act as testAct, create } from "react-test-renderer";
// ...
let root;
domAct(() => {
  testAct(() => {
    root = create(<App />);
  });

test-renderer
-----------------------------------------------------------
Test Renderer
Importing import TestRenderer from 'react-test-renderer'; // ES6
const TestRenderer = require('react-test-renderer'); // ES5 with npm Overview  This package provides a React renderer that can be used to render React components to pure JavaScript objects, without depending on the DOM or a native mobile environment. Essentially, this package makes it easy to grab a snapshot of the platform view hierarchy (similar to a DOM tree) rendered by a React DOM or React Native component without using a browser or jsdom. Example: import TestRenderer from 'react-test-renderer';
function Link(props) {
  return <a href={props.page}>{props.children}</a>;
}
const testRenderer = TestRenderer.create(
  <Link page="https://www.facebook.com/">Facebook</Link>
);
console.log(testRenderer.toJSON());
// { type: 'a',
//   props: { href: 'https://www.facebook.com/' },
//   children: [ 'Facebook' ] } You can use Jest’s snapshot testing feature to automatically save a copy of the JSON tree to a file and check in your tests that it hasn’t changed: Learn more about it. You can also traverse the output to find specific nodes and make assertions about them. import TestRenderer from 'react-test-renderer';
function MyComponent() {
  return (
    <div>
      <SubComponent foo="bar" />
      <p className="my">Hello</p>
    </div>
  )
}
function SubComponent() {
  return (
    <p className="sub">Sub</p>
  );
}
const testRenderer = TestRenderer.create(<MyComponent />);
const testInstance = testRenderer.root;
expect(testInstance.findByType(SubComponent).props.foo).toBe('bar');
expect(testInstance.findByProps({className: "sub"}).children).toEqual(['Sub']); TestRenderer   TestRenderer.create() TestRenderer.act()  TestRenderer instance   testRenderer.toJSON() testRenderer.toTree() testRenderer.update() testRenderer.unmount() testRenderer.getInstance() testRenderer.root  TestInstance   testInstance.find() testInstance.findByType() testInstance.findByProps() testInstance.findAll() testInstance.findAllByType() testInstance.findAllByProps() testInstance.instance testInstance.type testInstance.props testInstance.parent testInstance.children  Reference  
TestRenderer.create()  TestRenderer.create(element, options); Create a TestRenderer instance with the passed React element. It doesn’t use the real DOM, but it still fully renders the component tree into memory so you can make assertions about it. Returns a TestRenderer instance. 
TestRenderer.act()  TestRenderer.act(callback); Similar to the act() helper from react-dom/test-utils, TestRenderer.act prepares a component for assertions. Use this version of act() to wrap calls to TestRenderer.create and testRenderer.update. import {create, act} from 'react-test-renderer';
import App from './app.js'; // The component being tested
// render the component
let root; 
act(() => {
  root = create(<App value={1}/>)
});
// make assertions on root 
expect(root.toJSON()).toMatchSnapshot();
// update with some different props
act(() => {
  root.update(<App value={2}/>);
})
// make assertions on root 
expect(root.toJSON()).toMatchSnapshot(); 
testRenderer.toJSON()  testRenderer.toJSON() Return an object representing the rendered tree. This tree only contains the platform-specific nodes like <div> or <View> and their props, but doesn’t contain any user-written components. This is handy for snapshot testing. 
testRenderer.toTree()  testRenderer.toTree() Return an object representing the rendered tree. The representation is more detailed than the one provided by toJSON(), and includes the user-written components. You probably don’t need this method unless you’re writing your own assertion library on top of the test renderer. 
testRenderer.update()  testRenderer.update(element) Re-render the in-memory tree with a new root element. This simulates a React update at the root. If the new element has the same type and key as the previous element, the tree will be updated; otherwise, it will re-mount a new tree. 
testRenderer.unmount()  testRenderer.unmount() Unmount the in-memory tree, triggering the appropriate lifecycle events. 
testRenderer.getInstance()  testRenderer.getInstance() Return the instance corresponding to the root element, if available. This will not work if the root element is a function component because they don’t have instances. 
testRenderer.root  testRenderer.root Returns the root “test instance” object that is useful for making assertions about specific nodes in the tree. You can use it to find other “test instances” deeper below. 
testInstance.find()  testInstance.find(test) Find a single descendant test instance for which test(testInstance) returns true. If test(testInstance) does not return true for exactly one test instance, it will throw an error. 
testInstance.findByType()  testInstance.findByType(type) Find a single descendant test instance with the provided type. If there is not exactly one test instance with the provided type, it will throw an error. 
testInstance.findByProps()  testInstance.findByProps(props) Find a single descendant test instance with the provided props. If there is not exactly one test instance with the provided props, it will throw an error. 
testInstance.findAll()  testInstance.findAll(test) Find all descendant test instances for which test(testInstance) returns true. 
testInstance.findAllByType()  testInstance.findAllByType(type) Find all descendant test instances with the provided type. 
testInstance.findAllByProps()  testInstance.findAllByProps(props) Find all descendant test instances with the provided props. 
testInstance.instance  testInstance.instance The component instance corresponding to this test instance. It is only available for class components, as function components don’t have instances. It matches the this value inside the given component. 
testInstance.type  testInstance.type The component type corresponding to this test instance. For example, a <Button /> component has a type of Button. 
testInstance.props  testInstance.props The props corresponding to this test instance. For example, a <Button size="small" /> component has {size: 'small'} as props. 
testInstance.parent  testInstance.parent The parent test instance of this test instance. 
testInstance.children  testInstance.children The children test instances of this test instance. Ideas  You can pass createNodeMock function to TestRenderer.create as the option, which allows for custom mock refs. createNodeMock accepts the current element and should return a mock ref object. This is useful when you test a component that relies on refs. import TestRenderer from 'react-test-renderer';
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.input = null;
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    this.input.focus();
  }
  render() {
    return <input type="text" ref={el => this.input = el} />
  }
}
let focused = false;
TestRenderer.create(
  <MyComponent />,
  {
    createNodeMock: (element) => {
      if (element.type === 'input') {
        // mock a focus function
        return {
          focus: () => {
            focused = true;
          }
        };
      }
      return null;
    }
  }
);
expect(focused).toBe(true);

test-utils
-----------------------------------------------------------
Test Utilities
Importing import ReactTestUtils from 'react-dom/test-utils'; // ES6
var ReactTestUtils = require('react-dom/test-utils'); // ES5 with npm Overview  ReactTestUtils makes it easy to test React components in the testing framework of your choice. At Facebook we use Jest for painless JavaScript testing. Learn how to get started with Jest through the Jest website’s React Tutorial.  Note: We recommend using React Testing Library which is designed to enable and encourage writing tests that use your components as the end users do. For React versions <= 16, the Enzyme library makes it easy to assert, manipulate, and traverse your React Components’ output.   act() mockComponent() isElement() isElementOfType() isDOMComponent() isCompositeComponent() isCompositeComponentWithType() findAllInRenderedTree() scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithClass() findRenderedDOMComponentWithClass() scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithTag() findRenderedDOMComponentWithTag() scryRenderedComponentsWithType() findRenderedComponentWithType() renderIntoDocument() Simulate  Reference  
act()  To prepare a component for assertions, wrap the code rendering it and performing updates inside an act() call. This makes your test run closer to how React works in the browser.  Note If you use react-test-renderer, it also provides an act export that behaves the same way.  For example, let’s say we have this Counter component: class Counter extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {count: 0};
    this.handleClick = this.handleClick.bind(this);
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    document.title = `You clicked ${this.state.count} times`;
  }
  handleClick() {
    this.setState(state => ({
      count: state.count + 1,
    }));
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <p>You clicked {this.state.count} times</p>
        <button onClick={this.handleClick}>
          Click me
        </button>
      </div>
    );
  }
} Here is how we can test it: import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom';
import { act } from 'react-dom/test-utils';
import Counter from './Counter';
let container;
beforeEach(() => {
  container = document.createElement('div');
  document.body.appendChild(container);
});
afterEach(() => {
  document.body.removeChild(container);
  container = null;
});
it('can render and update a counter', () => {
  // Test first render and componentDidMount
  act(() => {
    ReactDOM.render(<Counter />, container);
  });
  const button = container.querySelector('button');
  const label = container.querySelector('p');
  expect(label.textContent).toBe('You clicked 0 times');
  expect(document.title).toBe('You clicked 0 times');
  // Test second render and componentDidUpdate
  act(() => {
    button.dispatchEvent(new MouseEvent('click', {bubbles: true}));
  });
  expect(label.textContent).toBe('You clicked 1 times');
  expect(document.title).toBe('You clicked 1 times');
});  Don’t forget that dispatching DOM events only works when the DOM container is added to the document. You can use a library like React Testing Library to reduce the boilerplate code. The recipes document contains more details on how act() behaves, with examples and usage.  
mockComponent()  mockComponent(
  componentClass,
  [mockTagName]
) Pass a mocked component module to this method to augment it with useful methods that allow it to be used as a dummy React component. Instead of rendering as usual, the component will become a simple <div> (or other tag if mockTagName is provided) containing any provided children.  Note: mockComponent() is a legacy API. We recommend using jest.mock() instead.  
isElement()  isElement(element) Returns true if element is any React element. 
isElementOfType()  isElementOfType(
  element,
  componentClass
) Returns true if element is a React element whose type is of a React componentClass. 
isDOMComponent()  isDOMComponent(instance) Returns true if instance is a DOM component (such as a <div> or <span>). 
isCompositeComponent()  isCompositeComponent(instance) Returns true if instance is a user-defined component, such as a class or a function. 
isCompositeComponentWithType()  isCompositeComponentWithType(
  instance,
  componentClass
) Returns true if instance is a component whose type is of a React componentClass. 
findAllInRenderedTree()  findAllInRenderedTree(
  tree,
  test
) Traverse all components in tree and accumulate all components where test(component) is true. This is not that useful on its own, but it’s used as a primitive for other test utils. 
scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithClass()  scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithClass(
  tree,
  className
) Finds all DOM elements of components in the rendered tree that are DOM components with the class name matching className. 
findRenderedDOMComponentWithClass()  findRenderedDOMComponentWithClass(
  tree,
  className
) Like scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithClass() but expects there to be one result, and returns that one result, or throws exception if there is any other number of matches besides one. 
scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithTag()  scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithTag(
  tree,
  tagName
) Finds all DOM elements of components in the rendered tree that are DOM components with the tag name matching tagName. 
findRenderedDOMComponentWithTag()  findRenderedDOMComponentWithTag(
  tree,
  tagName
) Like scryRenderedDOMComponentsWithTag() but expects there to be one result, and returns that one result, or throws exception if there is any other number of matches besides one. 
scryRenderedComponentsWithType()  scryRenderedComponentsWithType(
  tree,
  componentClass
) Finds all instances of components with type equal to componentClass. 
findRenderedComponentWithType()  findRenderedComponentWithType(
  tree,
  componentClass
) Same as scryRenderedComponentsWithType() but expects there to be one result and returns that one result, or throws exception if there is any other number of matches besides one. 
renderIntoDocument()  renderIntoDocument(element) Render a React element into a detached DOM node in the document. This function requires a DOM. It is effectively equivalent to: const domContainer = document.createElement('div');
ReactDOM.render(element, domContainer);  Note: You will need to have window, window.document and window.document.createElement globally available before you import React. Otherwise React will think it can’t access the DOM and methods like setState won’t work.  Other Utilities  
Simulate  Simulate.{eventName}(
  element,
  [eventData]
) Simulate an event dispatch on a DOM node with optional eventData event data. Simulate has a method for every event that React understands. Clicking an element // <button ref={(node) => this.button = node}>...</button>
const node = this.button;
ReactTestUtils.Simulate.click(node); Changing the value of an input field and then pressing ENTER. // <input ref={(node) => this.textInput = node} />
const node = this.textInput;
node.value = 'giraffe';
ReactTestUtils.Simulate.change(node);
ReactTestUtils.Simulate.keyDown(node, {key: "Enter", keyCode: 13, which: 13});  Note You will have to provide any event property that you’re using in your component (e.g. keyCode, which, etc…) as React is not creating any of these for you.  Is this page useful?

thinking-in-react
-----------------------------------------------------------
Thinking in React
React is, in our opinion, the premier way to build big, fast Web apps with JavaScript. It has scaled very well for us at Facebook and Instagram. One of the many great parts of React is how it makes you think about apps as you build them. In this document, we’ll walk you through the thought process of building a searchable product data table using React. Start With A Mock  Imagine that we already have a JSON API and a mock from our designer. The mock looks like this:        Our JSON API returns some data that looks like this: [
  {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$49.99", stocked: true, name: "Football"},
  {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$9.99", stocked: true, name: "Baseball"},
  {category: "Sporting Goods", price: "$29.99", stocked: false, name: "Basketball"},
  {category: "Electronics", price: "$99.99", stocked: true, name: "iPod Touch"},
  {category: "Electronics", price: "$399.99", stocked: false, name: "iPhone 5"},
  {category: "Electronics", price: "$199.99", stocked: true, name: "Nexus 7"}
]; Step 1: Break The UI Into A Component Hierarchy  The first thing you’ll want to do is to draw boxes around every component (and subcomponent) in the mock and give them all names. If you’re working with a designer, they may have already done this, so go talk to them! Their Photoshop layer names may end up being the names of your React components! But how do you know what should be its own component? Use the same techniques for deciding if you should create a new function or object. One such technique is the single responsibility principle, that is, a component should ideally only do one thing. If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller subcomponents. Since you’re often displaying a JSON data model to a user, you’ll find that if your model was built correctly, your UI (and therefore your component structure) will map nicely. That’s because UI and data models tend to adhere to the same information architecture. Separate your UI into components, where each component matches one piece of your data model.        You’ll see here that we have five components in our app. We’ve italicized the data each component represents. The numbers in the image correspond to the numbers below.  
FilterableProductTable (orange): contains the entirety of the example 
SearchBar (blue): receives all user input
 
ProductTable (green): displays and filters the data collection based on user input
 
ProductCategoryRow (turquoise): displays a heading for each category
 
ProductRow (red): displays a row for each product
  If you look at ProductTable, you’ll see that the table header (containing the “Name” and “Price” labels) isn’t its own component. This is a matter of preference, and there’s an argument to be made either way. For this example, we left it as part of ProductTable because it is part of rendering the data collection which is ProductTable’s responsibility. However, if this header grows to be complex (e.g., if we were to add affordances for sorting), it would certainly make sense to make this its own ProductTableHeader component. Now that we’ve identified the components in our mock, let’s arrange them into a hierarchy. Components that appear within another component in the mock should appear as a child in the hierarchy:   FilterableProductTable  SearchBar  ProductTable  ProductCategoryRow ProductRow      Step 2: Build A Static Version in React  See the Pen Thinking In React: Step 2 on CodePen. Now that you have your component hierarchy, it’s time to implement your app. The easiest way is to build a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity. It’s best to decouple these processes because building a static version requires a lot of typing and no thinking, and adding interactivity requires a lot of thinking and not a lot of typing. We’ll see why. To build a static version of your app that renders your data model, you’ll want to build components that reuse other components and pass data using props. props are a way of passing data from parent to child. If you’re familiar with the concept of state, don’t use state at all to build this static version. State is reserved only for interactivity, that is, data that changes over time. Since this is a static version of the app, you don’t need it. You can build top-down or bottom-up. That is, you can either start with building the components higher up in the hierarchy (i.e. starting with FilterableProductTable) or with the ones lower in it (ProductRow). In simpler examples, it’s usually easier to go top-down, and on larger projects, it’s easier to go bottom-up and write tests as you build. At the end of this step, you’ll have a library of reusable components that render your data model. The components will only have render() methods since this is a static version of your app. The component at the top of the hierarchy (FilterableProductTable) will take your data model as a prop. If you make a change to your underlying data model and call ReactDOM.render() again, the UI will be updated. You can see how your UI is updated and where to make changes. React’s one-way data flow (also called one-way binding) keeps everything modular and fast. Refer to the React docs if you need help executing this step. A Brief Interlude: Props vs State  There are two types of “model” data in React: props and state. It’s important to understand the distinction between the two; skim the official React docs if you aren’t sure what the difference is. See also FAQ: What is the difference between state and props? Step 3: Identify The Minimal (but complete) Representation Of UI State  To make your UI interactive, you need to be able to trigger changes to your underlying data model. React achieves this with state. To build your app correctly, you first need to think of the minimal set of mutable state that your app needs. The key here is DRY: Don’t Repeat Yourself. Figure out the absolute minimal representation of the state your application needs and compute everything else you need on-demand. For example, if you’re building a TODO list, keep an array of the TODO items around; don’t keep a separate state variable for the count. Instead, when you want to render the TODO count, take the length of the TODO items array. Think of all the pieces of data in our example application. We have:  The original list of products The search text the user has entered The value of the checkbox The filtered list of products  Let’s go through each one and figure out which one is state. Ask three questions about each piece of data:  Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state. Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state. Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.  The original list of products is passed in as props, so that’s not state. The search text and the checkbox seem to be state since they change over time and can’t be computed from anything. And finally, the filtered list of products isn’t state because it can be computed by combining the original list of products with the search text and value of the checkbox. So finally, our state is:  The search text the user has entered The value of the checkbox  Step 4: Identify Where Your State Should Live  See the Pen Thinking In React: Step 4 on CodePen. OK, so we’ve identified what the minimal set of app state is. Next, we need to identify which component mutates, or owns, this state. Remember: React is all about one-way data flow down the component hierarchy. It may not be immediately clear which component should own what state. This is often the most challenging part for newcomers to understand, so follow these steps to figure it out: For each piece of state in your application:  Identify every component that renders something based on that state. Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy). Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state. If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.  Let’s run through this strategy for our application:  
ProductTable needs to filter the product list based on state and SearchBar needs to display the search text and checked state. The common owner component is FilterableProductTable. It conceptually makes sense for the filter text and checked value to live in FilterableProductTable
  Cool, so we’ve decided that our state lives in FilterableProductTable. First, add an instance property this.state = {filterText: '', inStockOnly: false} to FilterableProductTable’s constructor to reflect the initial state of your application. Then, pass filterText and inStockOnly to ProductTable and SearchBar as a prop. Finally, use these props to filter the rows in ProductTable and set the values of the form fields in SearchBar. You can start seeing how your application will behave: set filterText to "ball" and refresh your app. You’ll see that the data table is updated correctly. Step 5: Add Inverse Data Flow  See the Pen Thinking In React: Step 5 on CodePen. So far, we’ve built an app that renders correctly as a function of props and state flowing down the hierarchy. Now it’s time to support data flowing the other way: the form components deep in the hierarchy need to update the state in FilterableProductTable. React makes this data flow explicit to help you understand how your program works, but it does require a little more typing than traditional two-way data binding. If you try to type or check the box in the previous version of the example (step 4), you’ll see that React ignores your input. This is intentional, as we’ve set the value prop of the input to always be equal to the state passed in from FilterableProductTable. Let’s think about what we want to happen. We want to make sure that whenever the user changes the form, we update the state to reflect the user input. Since components should only update their own state, FilterableProductTable will pass callbacks to SearchBar that will fire whenever the state should be updated. We can use the onChange event on the inputs to be notified of it. The callbacks passed by FilterableProductTable will call setState(), and the app will be updated. And That’s It  Hopefully, this gives you an idea of how to think about building components and applications with React. While it may be a little more typing than you’re used to, remember that code is read far more than it’s written, and it’s less difficult to read this modular, explicit code. As you start to build large libraries of components, you’ll appreciate this explicitness and modularity, and with code reuse, your lines of code will start to shrink. :)

typechecking-with-proptypes
-----------------------------------------------------------
Typechecking With PropTypes
 Note: React.PropTypes has moved into a different package since React v15.5. Please use the prop-types library instead. We provide a codemod script to automate the conversion.  As your app grows, you can catch a lot of bugs with typechecking. For some applications, you can use JavaScript extensions like Flow or TypeScript to typecheck your whole application. But even if you don’t use those, React has some built-in typechecking abilities. To run typechecking on the props for a component, you can assign the special propTypes property: import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>
    );
  }
}
Greeting.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string
}; In this example, we are using a class component, but the same functionality could also be applied to function components, or components created by React.memo or React.forwardRef. PropTypes exports a range of validators that can be used to make sure the data you receive is valid. In this example, we’re using PropTypes.string. When an invalid value is provided for a prop, a warning will be shown in the JavaScript console. For performance reasons, propTypes is only checked in development mode. PropTypes  Here is an example documenting the different validators provided: import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
MyComponent.propTypes = {
  // You can declare that a prop is a specific JS type. By default, these
  // are all optional.
  optionalArray: PropTypes.array,
  optionalBool: PropTypes.bool,
  optionalFunc: PropTypes.func,
  optionalNumber: PropTypes.number,
  optionalObject: PropTypes.object,
  optionalString: PropTypes.string,
  optionalSymbol: PropTypes.symbol,
  // Anything that can be rendered: numbers, strings, elements or an array
  // (or fragment) containing these types.
  optionalNode: PropTypes.node,
  // A React element.
  optionalElement: PropTypes.element,
  // A React element type (ie. MyComponent).
  optionalElementType: PropTypes.elementType,
  // You can also declare that a prop is an instance of a class. This uses
  // JS's instanceof operator.
  optionalMessage: PropTypes.instanceOf(Message),
  // You can ensure that your prop is limited to specific values by treating
  // it as an enum.
  optionalEnum: PropTypes.oneOf(['News', 'Photos']),
  // An object that could be one of many types
  optionalUnion: PropTypes.oneOfType([
    PropTypes.string,
    PropTypes.number,
    PropTypes.instanceOf(Message)
  ]),
  // An array of a certain type
  optionalArrayOf: PropTypes.arrayOf(PropTypes.number),
  // An object with property values of a certain type
  optionalObjectOf: PropTypes.objectOf(PropTypes.number),
  // An object taking on a particular shape
  optionalObjectWithShape: PropTypes.shape({
    color: PropTypes.string,
    fontSize: PropTypes.number
  }),
  // An object with warnings on extra properties
  optionalObjectWithStrictShape: PropTypes.exact({
    name: PropTypes.string,
    quantity: PropTypes.number
  }),   
  // You can chain any of the above with `isRequired` to make sure a warning
  // is shown if the prop isn't provided.
  requiredFunc: PropTypes.func.isRequired,
  // A required value of any data type
  requiredAny: PropTypes.any.isRequired,
  // You can also specify a custom validator. It should return an Error
  // object if the validation fails. Don't `console.warn` or throw, as this
  // won't work inside `oneOfType`.
  customProp: function(props, propName, componentName) {
    if (!/matchme/.test(props[propName])) {
      return new Error(
        'Invalid prop `' + propName + '` supplied to' +
        ' `' + componentName + '`. Validation failed.'
      );
    }
  },
  // You can also supply a custom validator to `arrayOf` and `objectOf`.
  // It should return an Error object if the validation fails. The validator
  // will be called for each key in the array or object. The first two
  // arguments of the validator are the array or object itself, and the
  // current item's key.
  customArrayProp: PropTypes.arrayOf(function(propValue, key, componentName, location, propFullName) {
    if (!/matchme/.test(propValue[key])) {
      return new Error(
        'Invalid prop `' + propFullName + '` supplied to' +
        ' `' + componentName + '`. Validation failed.'
      );
    }
  })
}; Requiring Single Child  With PropTypes.element you can specify that only a single child can be passed to a component as children. import PropTypes from 'prop-types';
class MyComponent extends React.Component {
  render() {
    // This must be exactly one element or it will warn.
    const children = this.props.children;
    return (
      <div>
        {children}
      </div>
    );
  }
}
MyComponent.propTypes = {
  children: PropTypes.element.isRequired
}; Default Prop Values  You can define default values for your props by assigning to the special defaultProps property: class Greeting extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hello, {this.props.name}</h1>
    );
  }
}
// Specifies the default values for props:
Greeting.defaultProps = {
  name: 'Stranger'
};
// Renders "Hello, Stranger":
ReactDOM.render(
  <Greeting />,
  document.getElementById('example')
); If you are using a Babel transform like plugin-proposal-class-properties (previously plugin-transform-class-properties), you can also declare defaultProps as static property within a React component class. This syntax has not yet been finalized though and will require a compilation step to work within a browser. For more information, see the class fields proposal. class Greeting extends React.Component {
  static defaultProps = {
    name: 'stranger'
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>Hello, {this.props.name}</div>
    )
  }
} The defaultProps will be used to ensure that this.props.name will have a value if it was not specified by the parent component. The propTypes typechecking happens after defaultProps are resolved, so typechecking will also apply to the defaultProps. Function Components  If you are using function components in your regular development, you may want to make some small changes to allow PropTypes to be properly applied. Let’s say you have a component like this: export default function HelloWorldComponent({ name }) {
  return (
    <div>Hello, {name}</div>
  )
} To add PropTypes, you may want to declare the component in a separate function before exporting, like this: function HelloWorldComponent({ name }) {
  return (
    <div>Hello, {name}</div>
  )
}
export default HelloWorldComponent Then, you can add PropTypes directly to the HelloWorldComponent: import PropTypes from 'prop-types'
function HelloWorldComponent({ name }) {
  return (
    <div>Hello, {name}</div>
  )
}
HelloWorldComponent.propTypes = {
  name: PropTypes.string
}
export default HelloWorldComponent

uncontrolled-components
-----------------------------------------------------------
Uncontrolled Components
In most cases, we recommend using controlled components to implement forms. In a controlled component, form data is handled by a React component. The alternative is uncontrolled components, where form data is handled by the DOM itself. To write an uncontrolled component, instead of writing an event handler for every state update, you can use a ref to get form values from the DOM. For example, this code accepts a single name in an uncontrolled component: class NameForm extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
    this.input = React.createRef();
  }
  handleSubmit(event) {
    alert('A name was submitted: ' + this.input.current.value);
    event.preventDefault();
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Name:
          <input type="text" ref={this.input} />
        </label>
        <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
      </form>
    );
  }
} Try it on CodePen Since an uncontrolled component keeps the source of truth in the DOM, it is sometimes easier to integrate React and non-React code when using uncontrolled components. It can also be slightly less code if you want to be quick and dirty. Otherwise, you should usually use controlled components. If it’s still not clear which type of component you should use for a particular situation, you might find this article on controlled versus uncontrolled inputs to be helpful. Default Values  In the React rendering lifecycle, the value attribute on form elements will override the value in the DOM. With an uncontrolled component, you often want React to specify the initial value, but leave subsequent updates uncontrolled. To handle this case, you can specify a defaultValue attribute instead of value. Changing the value of defaultValue attribute after a component has mounted will not cause any update of the value in the DOM. render() {
  return (
    <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
      <label>
        Name:
        <input
          defaultValue="Bob"          type="text"
          ref={this.input} />
      </label>
      <input type="submit" value="Submit" />
    </form>
  );
} Likewise, <input type="checkbox"> and <input type="radio"> support defaultChecked, and <select> and <textarea> supports defaultValue. The file input Tag  In HTML, an <input type="file"> lets the user choose one or more files from their device storage to be uploaded to a server or manipulated by JavaScript via the File API. <input type="file" /> In React, an <input type="file" /> is always an uncontrolled component because its value can only be set by a user, and not programmatically. You should use the File API to interact with the files. The following example shows how to create a ref to the DOM node to access file(s) in a submit handler:
class FileInput extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.handleSubmit = this.handleSubmit.bind(this);
    this.fileInput = React.createRef();
  }
  handleSubmit(event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert(
      `Selected file - ${this.fileInput.current.files[0].name}`
    );
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <form onSubmit={this.handleSubmit}>
        <label>
          Upload file:
          <input type="file" ref={this.fileInput} />
        </label>
        <br />
        <button type="submit">Submit</button>
      </form>
    );
  }
}
ReactDOM.render(
  <FileInput />,
  document.getElementById('root')
); Try it on CodePen

web-components
-----------------------------------------------------------
Web Components
React and Web Components are built to solve different problems. Web Components provide strong encapsulation for reusable components, while React provides a declarative library that keeps the DOM in sync with your data. The two goals are complementary. As a developer, you are free to use React in your Web Components, or to use Web Components in React, or both. Most people who use React don’t use Web Components, but you may want to, especially if you are using third-party UI components that are written using Web Components. Using Web Components in React  class HelloMessage extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <div>Hello <x-search>{this.props.name}</x-search>!</div>;
  }
}  Note: Web Components often expose an imperative API. For instance, a video Web Component might expose play() and pause() functions. To access the imperative APIs of a Web Component, you will need to use a ref to interact with the DOM node directly. If you are using third-party Web Components, the best solution is to write a React component that behaves as a wrapper for your Web Component. Events emitted by a Web Component may not properly propagate through a React render tree. You will need to manually attach event handlers to handle these events within your React components.  One common confusion is that Web Components use “class” instead of “className”. function BrickFlipbox() {
  return (
    <brick-flipbox class="demo">
      <div>front</div>
      <div>back</div>
    </brick-flipbox>
  );
} Using React in your Web Components  class XSearch extends HTMLElement {
  connectedCallback() {
    const mountPoint = document.createElement('span');
    this.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' }).appendChild(mountPoint);
    const name = this.getAttribute('name');
    const url = 'https://www.google.com/search?q=' + encodeURIComponent(name);
    ReactDOM.render(<a href={url}>{name}</a>, mountPoint);
  }
}
customElements.define('x-search', XSearch);  Note: This code will not work if you transform classes with Babel. See this issue for the discussion. Include the custom-elements-es5-adapter before you load your web components to fix this issue.
